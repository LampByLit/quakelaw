The landlord raised the matter of the back rents due at a trial on the tenant’s claim for damages.\nSection 83.67(4), Fla. Stat., provides that an illegally evicted tenant shall be awarded three times the rent or actual damages, whichever is greater. The minimum damages provided are mandatory and the trial court has no discretion to set off the landlord’s losses against the tenant’s award.\nAs to attorneys’ fees, the trial court set the award without making the findings required by Florida Patient’s Comp. Fund v Rowe, 472 So. 2d 1145 (Fla. 1985).\nAccordingly, the final judgment is REVERSED and this cause REMANDED with instructions to enter judgment in the sum of $900 in favor of the tenant and to reconsider the award of attorneys’ fees according to the requirements of Rowe. REVERSED AND REMANDED.\nGOLDMAN, and DONNER, JJ., concur.",
