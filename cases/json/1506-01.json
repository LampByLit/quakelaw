That there was no condition that she be discharged â€œwith medical approval,â€ and\n2. That no time was set in which she was required to report to the probation officer of Bexar County for further terms of probation.\nAppellant cites as her only authority Ex parte Pittman, 157 Texas Cr. Rep. 306, 248 S.W. 2d 159. We cannot agree that Pittman supports either of appellantâ€™s contentions, nor are we aware of any authority which would do so.\nWe have concluded that the terms of probation were sufficiently definite and that a violation of each of them has been shown.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
