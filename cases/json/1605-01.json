He stated that the male occupant of the other automobile got out, came back to his automobile, and charged him with having run into his automobile, that the woman did not get out of the automobile in question until the police arrived, and that no other person than the man in question got in or out of the automobile during this period of time.\nAccident Investigator Williams testified that when he arrived upon the scene the appellant was seated in the lead automobile alone and that from the odor of her breath, the manner of her speaking and walking, he concluded that she was intoxicated.\nAppellant did not testify but called the witness Turman, who testified that he and the appellant had been at the home of a friend drinking beer prior to the collision, that he had driven the automobile in question to the scene of the accident, where it came to a halt because of a defective battery, and that the automobile driven by the witness Welch had come around the corner and run into the rear of the automobile which he was driving.\nThe judge who heard the witnesses resolved this conflict in their evidence against the appellant, and we find the evidence sufficient to support his judgment. Monroe v. State, 166 Texas Cr. Rep. 459, 314 S.W. 2d 605; Cave v. State, 161 Texas Cr. Rep. 107, 274 S.W. 2d 839; and Smith v. State, 161 Texas Cr. Rep. 620, 273 S.W. 2d 623.\nFinding no reversible error, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.",
