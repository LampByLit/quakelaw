JOPLING, Circuit Judge.\nTHIS CAUSE having come to be heard and after hearing argument and reviewing memoranda filed by counsel the court finds as follows:\n1. The Plaintiffs and Intervenor Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services (the â€œDepartmentâ€) stipulated as to the significant facts of the case, which are as stipulated in the Joint Stipulation dated February 13, 1990. Editorâ€™s Note: Joint Stipulation attached hereto.\n2. Plaintiffs stipulated as to the intervention of the Department in this case.\n3. Pursuant to Â§409.266(4), Fla. Stat. (1989), the Department is entitled to recovery in full of all amounts of medical expenses provided by the Florida Medicaid Program on behalf of Charles E. Conners, Plaintiff (â€œConnersâ€), in the amount of $14,383.06.\n(a) The Department has an assignment of Connersâ€™ right to any payments for medical care from a third party, in the amount of $14,383.06, the amount of medical assistance paid by the Department. Â§ 409.266(4)(c), Fla. Stat. (1989); 42 CFR Â§ 433.145 â€” Â§ 433.146.\n(b) Since the Department has paid for medical care pursuant to the Florida Medicaid program, the Department has a lien, for the amount of $14,383.06, the amount of medical assistance paid, upon collateral consisting of the present cause of action at issue in this case, which accrued to Plaintiff Conners as a result of sickness, injury, disease or disability due to the liability of a third party which necessitated the medical care. Â§ 409.266(4)(f), Fla. Stat. (1989).\n(c) The Department is automatically subrogated to any rights Plaintiff Conners has to third party payments, and is to recover to the fullest extent possible the amount of medical assistance payments made on Connersâ€™ behalf by Medicaid. Â§ 409.266(4)(b), Fla. Stat. (1989). The Department, as a subrogee which has paid medical expenses, is not limited to a portion of its outlay on the basis of equitable distribution or equitable adjustment. Travelers Ins. Co. v Rodriquez, 387 So.2d 341, 343 (Fla. 1980).\n(d) The Departmentâ€™s rights are not diminished or affected as a result of the recipientâ€™s settlement agreement or agreement to pay contingency fees. Â§ 409.266(4)(e), Fla. Stat. (1989).\n(e) Plaintiff Conners relies upon the case of Underwood v Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services, 551 So.2d 522 (Fla. 2d DCA, September 15, 1989) (reh. den. November 8, 1989, mandate issued November 28, 1989, Notice to Invoke Discretionary Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court filed December 8, 1989).\nWithout deciding as to whether Underwood is binding upon this court, under Stanfil v State 384 So.2d 141 (Fla. 1980), this court finds that the facts in the present case are distinguishable from those in Underwood.\nAppellant Underwood had grievous injuries claimed to be worth $3 million for which only $105,000 in insurance was available, $100,000 liability coverage and $5,000 medical pay coverage. In the present case, although a verdict showed Plaintiff Connersâ€™ damages to be $800,000, Connersâ€™ damages agreed upon by Conners and Defendant were $400,000. The reduction of the amount of damages was the result of Connersâ€™ actions, both his own comparative negligence and his settlement agreement. The Department took no part in either. Unlike the situation in Underwood, apparently there were sufficient resources in this case to pay both the claim of Conners and that of his wife.\nThe 50% reduction in damages was solely due to the actions of Conners, through his negligence and agreement with defendant, after an evaluation of the value of his case. Since no action of a Medicaid recipient can prejudice the subrogation rights of the Department (Â§ 409.266(4)(e), Fla. Stat.), the 50% reduction agreed to by Conners cannot have the effect of reducing or prorating recovery by the Department. In Underwood, the prorating was not due to the action of the recipient, but due to lack of sufficient third party resources to cover Appellant Underwoodâ€™s damages. Accordingly, the equitable prorating established in Underwood should not be applicable in this case.\nThe Plaintiff Charles Connersâ€™ claim having been settled for an amount far in excess of the medical assistance paid by Medicaid, it is\nORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services be, and the same is, hereby entitled to recover from the proceeds of the settlement in this case, the full amount of medical assistance paid on behalf of Plaintiff Charles E. Conners in the amount of Fourteen Thousand Three Hundred Eighty Three Dollars and Six Cents ($14,383.06) from Plaintiffs or any person holding the proceeds of settlement on Plaintiffs behalf.\nDONE AND ORDERED this 13th day of March, 1990, in Chambers at Lake City, Florida.\nIN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD JUDICIAL CIRCUIT IN AND FOR MADISON COUNTY, FLORIDA\nCHARLES E. CONNERS and SYLVIA M. CONNERS, his wife\nJOINT STIPULATION\nPlaintiffs Charles E. Conners (\"Recipient\") and Sylvia M. Conners, his wife, and Intervenor, Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services (the \"Department\") by and through their undersigned Counsel, jointly stipulate to the following matters:\n1. On or about February 19, 1987, Recipient received injuries which are the basis of the current litigation and for which Recipient received medical assistance under the Florida Medicaid Program.\n2. The Florida Medicaid Program is a joint program between state and federal governments pursuant to Section 409.266, Fla. Stat. (Supp. 1988) and Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 USC 1396, et seg. The Florida Medicaid Program is administered in Florida by the Department under said statutes and state and federal rules\u0027 and regulations promulgated under such statutes.\n3. Medicaid provided medical assistance in the amount of $14,383.06 on behalf of the Recipient related to his injuries stated in paragraph 1, for medical care provided between February 19, 1987 and April 30, 1987.\n4. The $14,383.06 paid by Medicaid covered medical charges of $43,145.06, as provided on Exhibit \"A\" hereto.\n5. Pursuant to section 409.266(4)(f), Fla. Stat., a verified Statement of Lien was, filed on October 6, 1989 in the Official Records of Madison County, Florida in Book 205, pages 259 through 262. The copy of said Statement of Lien attached hereto as Exhibit \"B\" is a true and correct copy. There is no dispute as to the amount of the lien.\n6. Plaintiffs do not dispute the existence of a Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services interest pursuant to Section 409.266(4), Fla. Stat.\n7. A verdict was rendered in the present case on October 11, 1989, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit \"C\". Pursuant to the verdict:\n(a) The amount of damages sustained by Recipient Charles Conners was determined to be $800,000, and by Sylvia Conners to be $200,000.\n(b) Charles Conners was determined to be 30% negligent.\n8. A thirty percent (30%) reduction was made in recovery by Plaintiffs because of the comparative negligence of Mr. Conner.\n9. Upon further evaluation of the case\", Plaintiff\u0027s agreed with Defendant to compromise their claims an additional twenty percent (20%).\n10. Plaintiffs received a net settlement of $500,000, present value of agreed damages, $400,000 of which is attributable to Recipient Charles Conners of $100,000 of which is attributable to his wife, Sylvia Conners.\n11. On or about November 21, 1989, Plaintiff\u0027s and their attorney (\"Releasing Parties\"), and Federated Mutual Insurance Company and its insured, the Defendant, J.T. Hinton Oil Company (\"Released Parties\"), entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release of All Claims, pursuant to which the Releasing Parties, inter alia, purport to release the Released Parties, and the Released Parties, inter alia, agreed to make immediate cash payments to the Releasing Parties of $317,849 and certain additional future periodic payments.\n12. At no time was the Intervenor Department made a party to, nor did it participate in, settlement discussions or the settlement between the Plaintiffs, Defendant and Federated Mutual Insurance Company.\n13. Plaintiffs have entered a contingency fee arrangement with their attorney pursuant to which they are obligated to pay a 40 percent attorney\u0027s fee. Their attorney incurred $13,596.63 in costs in pursuing the case against Defendant.\n14. Both parties to this Joint Stipulation have read the foregoing and stipulate to said matters. -\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, Plaintiffs and Intervenor, by and through their undersigned counsel, have executed this Joint Stipulation this day of February, 1990.\nPLAINTIFFS INTERVENOR\nCHARLES E.

Stat (the \"Act\"), and, pursuant to its authority, it has construed the Act with regard to the lien and subrogation rights created thereby. The administrative construction of a statute by an agency charged with its administration is entitled to great weight and will not be overturned unless and unnl clearly erroneous. State exrel.Biscayne Kennel Club v. Board of Business Regulaaon. 276 So.2d 823 (Fla. 1983).\nThe Department, in construing the Act, has determined that the lien provided far in the Act (hereinafter \"Medicaid Lien\") is similar to, although having priority over, statutory hospital liens, and that certain judicial decisions and reasoning as to hospital liens are applicable, in whole or in part, to Medicaid Liens. Specifically, the Department has determined that the lien provided for in the Act attaches when a recipient first receives treatment qualifying for coverage under the Act, and attaches to all causes of action, including settlements, judgements and awards thereon, for all amoous of medical assistance paid by Medicaid related to a specific accident or illness; that the statement ofÃ¼enoeed not be filed prior to any settlement, judgement or awatd to attach thereto, and that any settlement, judgement or award without a release of lien or settlement from the Department creates a cause of action in favor of the Department [see. State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co. v. Palm Springs Gen. Hosp., 232 So 2d 737 (Fla. 1970)]; that a Medicaid Lien is not restricted to some portion of the recovery which the pames or courts choose to designate as being in compensation for medical expenses incurred, but that a Medicaid Lien applies to whatever is recovered against a third party [see. Dade County v. Peres, 237 So2d 781 (Fla. 3d DCA 1970)]; that a Medicaid Lien is meant to be effective for its full amount, and must be applied in full against proceeds of a judgement or a settlement, and may not be reduced on equitable principles or applied against only a portion of the proceeds of a judgement or a settlement (see. Dade County v. Bodie, 237 So2d 353 (Fit. 3d DCA 1970)]; that a Medicaid Lien may not be impaired or diminished by the amount of attorneys\u0027 fees which may be due to a Medicaid recipientâ€™s attorney (see. Hosp. Bd. of Directors v. McCray, 456 So 2d 936 (Fla. 2nd DCA 1984); Crowder v. Dade County, 415 So2d 732 (Fla. 3d DCA 1982)]; and a Medicaid Lien is superior to the liens and charges of all other. health care providers, including hospitals, inasmuch as Medicaid is intended to be the payer of last resort ail third party resources are to be exhausted before Medicaid* obligation arises, and the Department is authorized by the Act to collect directly from any provider if thud party payment for medical services has been recovered by the provider.\nSee generally, Section 409266(4Xa)Xb) and (f), Fla. Stat; 42 U.S.C. Section 1396a(cX2SXA); 42 CFJL Section 433.137(a).\nThe Department has determined that a Medicaid Lien extends to proceeds on the collateral set forth in the Act because of the legislative intent and policy that the Department recover to the fullest extent possible the amount it has paid for medical assistance if a third party is liable. The term \"proceedsâ€ includes whatever is received upon the sale, exchange, collection, or other disporiooo of collateral or proceeds, and insurance payable by reason of loss or damage Â»o the collateral or proceeds.\nThe Department ha* determined that the filing of a verified statement of lien (a \"Statement\u0027\u0027) is not required - for the creation, attachment, or perfection of a Medicaid Lien, and that a Medicaid Lien is automatically perfected at the tÃ­me of its attachment; that the filing of a Statement within one year of the date of last payment is permitted by the Act and constitutes notice of a Medicaid Lien, relating back to the time of attachment of the lien, to all third persons, including, without limitation, creditots, providers of medical care, and all persons firms or corporations who may be liable on account of any sickness, disease, disability, injury or death, whether or not named m the Statement, and whether or not a copy of the Statement has been received by them; that the filing of a Statement is not necessary to protect the Department\u0027s rights against a recipient; that a tardy filing of a Statement does not invalidate a Medicaid lien, but results only in the elimination of a third person being charged with constructive notice by reason of filing until such time as the Statementis actually filed; that a thud person with notice or knowledge that an individual is a Medicaid recipient or has had Medicaid payments made on his behalf is charged with the duty of inquiry into the existence of a lien or subrogation rights under the Act; that the logical interpretation of the legislative intent of the Act is to assure the Department of its nghts to receive the amount of any benefit to the full extent of third parry liability up to the amount paid by Medicaid. Cfâ€ž Public Health Trust of Dade County v. Carroll, 509 So2d 1232 (Fla. 4th DCA 1987).\nIn addition to the Departmentâ€™s right to a lien, the Act grants the Department a separate, disunguishable subrogarÃ¡Â» right, automatically subrogating the Department to any rights a Medicaid recipient has to third party payments, and requiring the Department to recover, if third patty resources are available, the full amount paid on behalf of the recipient for medical care, to the fullest extent of the third party resources. Section 409266(4Xb), Fla. Stat4 Fla. Admin. Code Rule 10C-7.0301(2Xb) St (3Xa). The Department has determined that common law subrogation principles are inapplicable when the Department seeks reimbursement pursuant to the Acu that the Department may recover the entire amount it pays on behalf of a recipient; that the Department must be paid before the recipient receives compensation, and that neither equitable nor legal principles may reduce recovery by the Department regardless of whether or not a recipient is made whole by a judgement or settlement. See. Coplien v. Dept, of Health and Social Services, 119 Wis. 2d 52,349 N.W2d 92 (Wis. App. 1984).\nThe Act creates an affirmauve duty on the part of a recipient to inform the Department of any right to third party payments, and the failure of the recipient or his legal representative to timely inform the Department and pay the Department from third party resources may consuute fraud or theft See generally. Sections 409.266(4)(b); 409-325(l)(b), 4(b) St (c); St 811014. Fla. Stat Certain transfers of the collateral contemplated in the Act or any proceeds therefrom, are fraudulent conveyances and may be void or voidable. See generally. Chapter 726, Fla. Stat. The transfer of the collateral or proceeds to a trust for the benefiftof a recipient or the rftipientâ€™s family, to the extent that it purports to place the collateral or proceeds beyond the readfof the Department or that operates to prejudice the legal or equitable nghts of the Department creates a prima facie presumption of fraud.\nIN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, IN AND FOR MADISON COUNTY, FLORIDA\nCHARLES E.
