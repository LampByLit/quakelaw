Stanford and, with drawn pistol, robbed him of his wallet and $136.58 from the cash register.\nThe appellant was seated in the car with the motor running, and drove rapidly away as soon as Ray got in the car with the fruits of the robbery.\nThe jury found appellant guilty as a principal in aiding Ray in the commission of the robbery. We find the evidence sufficient to sustain the verdict.\nThere are no formal bills of exception and no informal bills which show error. No brief has been filed in appellant’s behalf.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
