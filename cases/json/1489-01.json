He stated that he followéd the appellant’s automobile for several blocks, during which time the appellant was exceeding the speed limit, that he brought the appellant to a halt, and that while questioning him the appellant attempted to take his (Flores’) gun out of its holster. After he had put the handcuffs on the appellant, he saw a pistol on the front floorboard of appellant’s automobile and retrieved the same.\nThe sole question presented for review is the legality of the arrest and the finding of the pistol.\nWe have concluded that the information which the officer received plus the speeding violation which he observed authorized the arrest and the incident search of the automobile, if in fact one was made.
