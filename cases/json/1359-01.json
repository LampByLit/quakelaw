In answer to the state’s question whether it took two officers at the police station to carry the man, the officer said: “Yes, sir, and she (the appellant) refused to take a blood test.”\nAppellant objected to the officer’s answer because he volunteered information which was not admissible and was highly inflammatory. The appellant moved the court to declare a mistrial which was overruled and to such action of the court she excepted.\nIn Jordan v. State, 163 Texas Cr. Rep. 287, 290 S.W. 2d 666, a driving while intoxicated case, where the officer while testifying volunteered the same character of testimony as here complained of, we said:\n“While it is true that the jury were instructed not to consider the answer, we have concluded that this answer got before the jury the inadmissible evidence that the appellant had been offered a blood test and had refused to take it. See Cardwell v. State, 156 Texas Cr. Rep. 457, 243 S.W. 2d 702, and cases there cited.”\nFor the error pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.\nOpinion approved by the Court.",
