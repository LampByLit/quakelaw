The punishment was assessed at twelve yearsâ€™ confinement in the penitentiary, under the mandate of Art. 62, P.C.\nAt the outset we are met with a motion to quash the indictment on the grounds that the primary offense of burglary is not the â€œ â€˜same offense, or one of the same natureâ€™ â€ as that of passing, as true, a forged instrument, the offense for which the appellant was convicted in the prior case alleged for enhancement.\nWere this a case of first impression it might cause us more concern, but this court specifically held in Brown v. State, 140 Texas Cr. Rep. 133, 143 S.W. 2d 775, that burglary and forgery are not offenses of the same nature as prescribed by Art. 62, P.C.\nThe judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.",
