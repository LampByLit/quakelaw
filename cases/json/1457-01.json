Bowles v. State, 66 Texas Cr. Rep. 550, 147 S.W. 869. See, also, Smith v. State, 149 Texas Cr. Rep. 7, 190 S.W. 2d 880, and Davis v. State, 135 Texas Cr. Rep. 659, 122 S.W. 2d 635.\nHere, according to appellantâ€™s own contention, there was an issue clearly drawn, under the facts, as to whether his admitted deviation was from either the nearest or most practical route and his stoppage, in route, was more than momentary.\nIt was for the trial court before whom this case was tried to determine that issue. He did determine it against the appellant.\nWe can not say that his determination thereof was not warranted under appellantâ€™s own contention and admission.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
