In the motion appellant alleged that the agent led him to believe that he was a Federal officer and promised him that .if he would plead guilty he would receive as punishment a minimum fine of $100 and also threatened to take him to Abilene, Texas and file charges against him in Federal Court unless he entered the plea of guilty.\nThe motion was not sworn to or supported by the affidavit of appellant or any other person.\nThe unverified motion was insufficient as a pleading and the court’s action in overruling the same cannot be assigned as error.
