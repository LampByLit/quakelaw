Recently, in Ex parte Padgett, 161 Texas Cr. Rep. 498, 278 S.W. 2d 865, we thoroughly discussed this identical question.\nIt is ordered that relator be relieved from further confinement in the penitentiary under said conviction and that he be delivered by the penitentiary authorities to the sheriff of Taylor County to answer in the district court of such county to the indictment which was originally returned against him in cause No. 1943-B.\nIt is so ordered.",
