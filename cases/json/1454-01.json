                                          "text":  "WOODLEY, Judge.\nThe offense is arson; the punishment, two years.\nThe house which burned on the night of February 8, 1958, is described in the evidence as an old house consisting of an early type bus chassis used as a bedroom, around which had been built a frame room on the west, used as a living room, and another room on the east used as a kitchen, with two porches on the south, one in front and the other in back of the bus chassis. It was an old house, â€œpretty well run downâ€; â€œan old beat up house.â€\nThere was no water piped to the house and no bathroom.\nAppellant obtained a fire insurance policy on this house on December 29, 1957, the policy issuing in the name of â€œEmmer Blankenship Estate.â€ The amount of the policy was $1,000.00, with vacancy clause which the agent explained to appellant would reduce the amount payable to two-thirds of that amount. Some eleven days later, appellant had the policy changed to himself as owner, representing that he had purchased the house from his grandmother and was fixing it up to live in.\nOn January 27, 1958, appellant purchased and took delivery of some household furniture and appliances in Fort Worth, paying for the lot $154.00.\nOn January 30, 1958, appellant secured endorsement on the policy so as to insure the household goods in the house for $1000.00. \u0027\nNine days later the house burned during the night and appellant drove to a nearby residence and reported the fire.\nSeeing that he was in his shorts, the neighbor offered him a pair of pants which he declined, saying that he had a pair in his pickup.\nAmong the items purchased by appellant in Fort Worth on January 27 were:\nâ€œOne Frigidaire refrigerator, as is_ 5.00\nOne Orbin range_ 16.00\nOne Bendix washer_ 5.00\nOne ABC Automatic washer, as is_ 6.00\nOne Leather Couch_ 3.00\nOne Ironer _ 11.50â€\nAfter the fire appellant furnished a list of the household goods that were in the house at the time of the fire which included, among other items:\nâ€œ1 â€” Automatic washer _$125.00\n1 â€” Full size range_ 139.50\n1 â€” T Refrigerator _ 90.00\n1 â€” Automatic Ironer_ 90.00\n1 â€” Leather Office Couch_ 140.00â€\nIn the burned house, after the fire, was found the remains of an automatic washer which appeared to be an ABC; an Ironer, a Simplex; a range which appeared to be an Orbin; and there was a Frigidaire â€œice boxâ€ and a leather couch.\nJames Evans, Arson Investigator in the Fire Prevention Division of the State Board of Insurance, testified that he had a conversation with appellant on February 25, 1958; that appellant said that he purchased the furniture that was in the house from Summers Furniture Company in Fort Worth, paying in excess of $1,000.00 therefor.\nAfter Evans had checked with Summers Furniture Company he advised appellant that he had found out he had not purchased any furniture there and appellant then admitted he had lied.\nA deed from Mrs. Emmer Blankenship to appellant, dated February 11, 1958 (three days after the fire) was offered in evidence. It recites a consideration of $500.00 to be paid at the rate of $1.00 per month, and purports to convey the property upon which the house in question was located to appellant.\nIt was appellantâ€™s testimony that before the fire he had orally entered into agreement with his 93 year old grandmother whereby he would acquire her interest in the house in exchange for providing a proper burial for her at her death, which he did by purchase of a burial policy for which he obligated himself to pay $10 per month.\nThere was considerable testimony regarding a five gallon Butane tank or â€œBottleâ€ in the house, appellantâ€™s theory being that there was a leak in the pipe leading from it to the melting pot he was using as a heater, both the tank and the fire being in the bedroom.\nThe stateâ€™s testimony, on the other hand, was that the Butane tank was on the porch, as was the portion of the pipe which the defense testimony showed had a leak; that the kitchen and living room floors were unevenly burned (spots or portions burned through and cracks burned out) indicating to stateâ€™s expert witnesses that an inflammable liquid had been used on the floors. It was also testified by the stateâ€™s expert witnesses that the fire could not have gotten to the living room from the Butane tank; that in their opinion the fire was set, and that it could not have been Butane that caused the floors to burn as they did.\nThere is much other evidence such as appellantâ€™s occupancy of the premises and repairs and painting he testified he had made; and the testimony of the appellantâ€™s expert witness, who viewed the burned premises for the first time after the bus chassis portion had been removed, and based his opinion on the assumption that the Butane tank was in the house and not on the porch at the time of the fire.\nThe jury chose to accept the stateâ€™s version and reject the theory that the fire was caused by the accidental ignition of Butane gas which had escaped into the bedroom.\nThis court must view the circumstantial evidence in the light most favorable to the juryâ€™s verdict, in passing upon its sufficiency. Isaac v. State, 158 Texas Cr. Rep. 540, 257 S.W. 2d 436; Texas Digest, Criminal Law, Key 1144(13).\nWe find the evidence sufficient to sustain the conviction.\nThe remaining point found in appellantâ€™s brief relates to the failure of the court to grant a continuance. We find nothing in the record to raise such a question.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
