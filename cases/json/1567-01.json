The value of the property destroyed or the extent of the injury inflicted thereon determines the punishment to be assessed.\nHere, the information charged that appellant wilfully destroyed a tire belonging to E. W. McCain, which tire was of the value of $35.\nIt was the state’s testimony that the tire was destroyed by cutting it with a knife.\nThere is no testimony showing the value of the tire or the extent of the injury thereupon inflicted.\nWithout such proof the state has not made a case.\nThe evidence is insufficient to support the verdict.\nThe judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.",
