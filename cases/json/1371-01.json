He stated that appellant reached for a pair of pants hanging on a nearby chair but that Officer Maroney grabbed the pants, searched them, and removed therefrom an eyedroper and hypodermic needle wrapped in a brown paper, and then handed the pants to the appellant, who put them on. Officer Maroney corroborated Rosasâ€™s testimony. The entire package was forwarded to the Department of Public Safety and Chemist TullÃ­s testified that he found traces of heroin on the needle and droper.\nDr. Dalkowitz testified that he examined the appellant shortly after his arrest and found that his arm had been punctured with a hypodermic needle.\nThe appellant did not testify in his own behalf, but called Escamilloâ€™s wife, who testified that the appellant and his wife were staying in her home at the time of his arrest, but denied that her husband had given the officers permission to search. He also called Henry, who further denied that he gave permission for the search, but also denied that the hypodermic needle and eyedropper belonged to him.\nThe jury resolved such disputed issues as there were against the appellant, and we find the evidence sufficient to support the verdict.\nNo formal bills of exception appear in the record, and no brief has been filed. We shall not discuss the informal bills of exception which appear in the record other than to observe that no reversible error is reflected thereby.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
