                                          "text":  "Appellant, the State of Florida, appeals an order suppressing evidence, obtained when the Defendant was arrested for D.U.I. The trial court granted the Defendantâ€™s motion to suppress the video tape of sobriety tests conducted by the Broward Sheriffs office.\nReversed and remanded.\nOn May 13, 1990, Officer Vincent Maffei of the Fort Lauderdale Police stopped Ms. McCelvey after he observed her driving in a reckless manner. The Defendantâ€™s eyes were bloodshot, her face was red and flushed. Officer Maffei had her step out of her vehicle and advised her he was conducting a criminal investigation for D.U.I. Without Mirandizing the Defendant, Officer Maffei asked if she would submit to roadside sobriety tests and she indicated she would. The Officer administered the tests on the scene. As a result the Defendant was transported to the Broward Sheriffâ€™s Department BAT unit for additional testing.\nBefore the tests were performed she was advised by the Community Service Aide present, of the fact a criminal investigation was being conducted and it was being video taped. The implied consent warning was read to the Defendant by Officer Maffei. The defendant was asked if she would submit to a breath test. She responded by asking to speak to her â€œlawyer and/or my captain first.â€ The Community Service Aide informed her â€œthat is not her right at this time.â€\nThe Defendant asked and was informed about the procedures for the various tests and that she did not have to take the tests if she did not wish to. The Defendant again voiced her desire to call her lawyer and stated she did not know if she wanted to take the tests. She was reminded by the Community Service Aide, if she refused to take the tests her license would be automatically suspended for 12 months. The Defendant then acquiesced to the tests being administered.\nAs part of the physical performance test the Defendant was instructed to recite the alphabet. She was unable to correctly complete the alphabet. The case was called up for a hearing on October 19, 1990. At the hearing counsel for the Defendant moved for suppression of the video tape on grounds the recitation was a statement obtained in violation of the Defendantâ€™s right to counsel. It was testimonial and served to incriminate the Defendant.\nThe trial court granted the motion on its finding the â€œverbalization of the alphabet. . .were revealing thought processes. They are designed to present probable cause or evidence of a mental confusion or to support an inference of mental confusion. . .â€\nThe trial courtâ€™s order is reversed.\nThe privilege against self-incrimination protects an accused only from being compelled to testify against himself, or otherwise provide the State with evidence of a testimonial or communicative nature. See, Pennsylvania v Muniz, 110 S.Ct. 2638 (1990), (citing Schmerber v California, 384 U.S. 757 (1966)). In order to be testimonial, an accusedâ€™s communication must itself, explicitly or implicitly, relate a factual assertion or disclose information. Only then is a person compelled to be a â€˜witnessâ€™ against himself. Id. at 2646, (citing Doe v United States, 487 U.S. 201 (1988)).\nIn Pennsylvania v Muniz, supra, the United States Supreme Court agreed with the state courtâ€™s conclusion that Miranda requires suppression of the video tape of the defendantâ€™s response to a question regarding the date of his sixth birthday. In his response Muniz indicated he did not know the date of his sixth birthday and his speech was slurred. The Court held Munizâ€™s answer to the question was incriminating â€œnot just because of his delivery, but also because of his answerâ€™s content; the trier of fact could infer from Munizâ€™s answer (that he did not know the proper date) that his mental state was confused.â€ Id. at 2645. Before arriving at itsâ€™ conclusion the court went through great pains to analyze whether or not the question required a testimonial answer on Munizâ€™s part. The analysis in Muniz, supra, is very much appropriate for this case.\nThe prosecution conceded and the Supreme Court agreed, any slurring of speech and other evidence of lack of muscular coordination revealed by the defendantâ€™s responses to the police officerâ€™s direct questioning constituted nontestimonial components of those responses. And by requiring a suspect to reveal the physical manner in which he articulates words, like requiring him to reveal the physical properties of the sound produced by his voice, does not, without more, compel him to provide a â€œtestimonialâ€ response. Id. at 2645. (relying on Schmerber and United States v Dionisio, 410 U.S. 1 (1973)).\nThe Court stated, the correct question for present purposes is whether the incriminating inference of mental confusion is drawn from a testimonial act or from physical evidence. Id. at 2646.\nAdditionally the Court stated,\n... In this case, the question is not whether a suspectâ€™s â€œimpaired mental facultiesâ€ can fairly be characterized as an aspect of his physiology, but rather whether Munizâ€™s response to the sixth birthday question that gave rise to the inference of such an impairment was testimonial in nature. Id. at 2646.\nThe Court in formulating its conclusion undertook a comparison of itsâ€™ prior holding in Schmerber. It pointed out in Schmerber, they held the police could compel a suspect to provide a blood sample in order to determine the physical make up of the suspectâ€™s blood and thereby draw an inference about whether he was intoxicated. The compulsion in Schmerber was outside of the Fifth Amendmentâ€™s protection, not simply because the evidence concerned the suspectâ€™s physical body, but rather because the evidence was obtained in a manner that did not entail any act on the part of the suspect. But in contrast, had the police instead asked the suspect directly whether his blood contained a high concentration of alcohol, his affirmative response would have been testimonial even though it would have been used to draw the same inference concerning his physiology. Id.\nThe Court goes further stating â€œWhenever a suspect is asked for a response requiring him to communicate an express or implied assertion of fact or belief, the suspect confronts the â€˜trilemmaâ€™ of truth, falsity, or silence and hence the response (whether based on truth or falsity) contains a testimonial component.â€ Id. at 2648.\nIn Munizâ€™s case, Muniz was confronted with this trilemma when the officer asked him if he knew the date of his sixth birthday and he could not remember or calculate that date. The Court reasoned, because of the coercive environment created by the custodial interrogation, Muniz was more or less precluded from remaining silent. He was left with the choice of incriminating himself by admitting that he did not then know the date of his sixth birthday, or answering untruthfully. The content of his truthful answer, he did not know the date, would support an inference by any reasonable trier of fact his mental faculties were impaired. If he had asserted untruthfully he knew the date and the date of his sixth birthday was different from the assertion, the same inference would attach. Hence, the incriminating inference of impaired mental faculties stemmed, not just from the fact that he slurred his response, but also from a testimonial aspect of that response.\nIn contrast, the request for Ms. McCelvey to repeat the alphabet did not require a testimonial response. The request to recite the alphabet did not require her to communicate an express or implied assertion of fact or belief. She was not faced with the â€œtrilemmaâ€ of truth, falsity, or silence. Thus, by reciting the alphabet the Defendant did not perform a testimonial act.\nAgain, as stated earlier in this opinion, in order to be testimonial, an accusedâ€™s communication must itself, explicitly or implicitly, relate a factual assertion or disclose information.\nThis Court further notes, â€œa person has no right to consult with an attorney prior to deciding whether to submit to a breathalyzer.â€ State v Hoch, 500 So.2d 597 (Fla. 3rd DCA 1986).\nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court reverse [sic] the order of the trial court which suppressed the video tape of the sobriety tests and remand for further proceedings.\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\nDONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at the Broward County Courthouse, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33301, this 9th day of September, 1991.",
