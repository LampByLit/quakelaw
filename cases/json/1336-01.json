Such is the holding of my brethren.\nIt is my conviction that the first section of Art. 666-4, Vernonâ€™s P.C., the liquor control act, makes unlawful the possession of a still capable of being used for manufacturing liquor. That section reads as follows:\nâ€œIt shall not be unlawful to manufacture, distill, brew, sell, import, export, transport, distribute, warehouse, store, possess, possess for the purpose of sale, bottle, rectify, blend, treat, fortify, mix, or process any liquor in this State, nor to possess any equipment or material designed for or capable of use for manufacturing liquor, provided that the rights and privileges so to do are granted by any provision of this Act. It is further expressly provided that any rights or privileges granted by the provisions of this Section, as exceptions to the prohibited acts in other sections shall be enjoyed and exercised only in the manner as provided. Any act done by any person which is not granted in this Act is hereby declared to be unlawful * * * .â€\nThat statute covers two fact situations. It says that it is not unlawful for one to possess a still capable of use in manufacturing liquor if, under the provisions of the liquor control act, the right to possess the still is authorized. In common practice and application, it is meant thereby that it is not unlawful to possess a still under a license or permit. The act then says that â€œAny act done by any person which is not granted in this Act is hereby declared to be unlawful.â€ That means nothing more or less, then, but that the possession of a still for the manufacture of liquor is unlawful and continues to be unlawful so long as no license or permit authorizes it to be possessed.\nBut my brethren say that it is unlawful to possess a still for the manufacture of only illicit liquor, and that to charge the commission of that unlawful act the information must allege that the still was possessed for the purpose of manufacturing an illicit beverage.\nA beverage does not become â€œillicitâ€ until it is manufactured and brought into existence. Whether the beverage is â€œlicitâ€ or â€œillicitâ€ depends upon the completed product and the possesion and handling thereof. An intoxicating beverage may be legally manufactured. What is done with it thereafter may make it an â€œillicitâ€ beverage.\nSo one may lawfully possess a still for the manufacture of intoxicating liquor and yet violate the law in the manufacture or the handling of the liquor thereafter, so as to render the possession of the still unlawful even with a license.\nIt was to such conditions and to control the possession and handling of the liquor after manufacture that Art. 666-17a, Vernonâ€™s P.C., was intended to apply.\nIt is a violation of the law for one to possess a still for the manufacture of intoxicating liquor. If the still is lawfully pos7 sessed, proof of such fact would constitute a complete defense.\nThe information charges a violation of the law and the prosecution ought not to be ordered dismissed.\nI respectfully dissent.",
