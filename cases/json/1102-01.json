In other words, the liquor may be a malt liquor and yet be a non-intoxicant. We are not passing upon the question as to whether the evidence in this case warranted the conviction. We think it does, but the converse of the proposition was aptly presented by the evidence. That is to say, the defendantâ€™s evidence showed that the liquor sold to prosecuting witness was a non-intoxicant, and the mere fact that appellant had a malt license would not be evidence of the fact that he was selling intoxicating liquor. See Barnes v. State, 44 S. W. Rep., 491, where the exact question here raised is fully discussed.\nWe do not think there is any merit in appellantâ€™s other assignments of error, but for the one pointed out the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.\nReversed and remanded.\nHenderson, Judge, absent.",
