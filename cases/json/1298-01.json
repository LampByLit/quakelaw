The hardship arose from circumstances peculiar to the property where only five of the seven lots owned by the applicant could be used for development. The parcel is located in two different jurisdictions causing this unusual situation.\nThe courts have clearly stated that they are not empowered to substitute their judgment for that of legislative and administrative bodies exercising objectives unless their action is shown to be â€œclearly arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, and having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, or welfare.â€ Bay View Investment, Inc. v Gringsby, 219 So.2d 760 (Fla. 2d DCA 1969); Construction Industry Association of Sonoma County v City of Petaluma, 522 F.2d 897 (9th Cir. 1976), cert. denied 424 U.S. 934, 96 S.Ct. 1148, 47 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976); Miami v Zorovich, 195 So.2d 31 (Fla. 3d DCA 1967). It is clear from the evidence in the record, as stated above, that the Cityâ€™s objective was reasonable and there is competent evidence to support the commissionâ€™s decision.\nTherefore, based upon the foregoing, we affirm the decision of the City Commission.",
