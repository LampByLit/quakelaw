State, 129 Texas Cr. Rep. 134, 83 S.W. 2d 974, it.was held that in a trial before the court without a jury, the trial judge, in the exercise of his discretion, had the right to refuse a suspended sentence to the person found guilty of burglary even though such person offered testimony that he had never been convicted of a felony and of his previous good reputation as a law abiding citizen. In Brown v. State, 156 Texas Cr. Rep. 652, 245 S.W. 2d 497, it was held that where the issue of suspended sentence was submitted to a jury the question of whether or not the sentence should be suspended was within the juryâ€™s discretion.\nThe right of parole or probation under the provisions of the Adult Probation and Parole Law, Art. 78ld, V.A.C.C.P., has been held to be a matter within the discretion of the trial court.
