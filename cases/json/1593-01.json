Did you make any statements to Mr. Whitehead as to what he saw there? A. No, sir.\nâ€œQ. Did you state to him or anybody else that something there was marihuana? A. No, Sir.â€\nThe package found under the pillow on the pool table was exhibited to appellant on cross-examination and he was asked if he knew what it was and if he had â€œseen this marihuana before,â€ both of which he answered in the negative.\nHe was then asked: â€œQ. You have never- seen marihuana before?â€ to which he replied â€œI never have seen marihuana before in my life.â€\nThe facts were then developed in the juryâ€™s absence after which the state was permitted to prove by appellant that on March 27, 1944, he pleaded guilty to the possession and sale of marihuana.\nThe authorities relied upon by appellant dealing with proof of a prior conviction so remote as to have no tendency to discredit the witness are not here applicable. The question is not whether the prior conviction was admissible, but whether it was proper to allow the state to impeach the testimony of appellant that he had never seen marihuana in his life by showing that he had previously pleaded guilty to possession and sale of marihuana.\nAppellant testified that he did not identify the contents of the package found on a pool table in his establishment as marihuana, as the officers testified he did, and attempted to bolster his denial and his failure to recognize the marihuana in this package, when exhibited to him at the trial, by testifying â€œI never have seen marihuana before in my life.â€ The trial court did not err in permitting the state to show by him that, on the contrary he pleaded guilty to the possession and sale of marihuana in 1944. It was admissible for the purpose of impeaching such testimony of the appellant and showing it to be false. Kemp v. State, 157 Texas Cr. Rep. 158, 247 S.W. 2d 308; Lampkin v. State, 47 Texas Cr. Rep. 625, 85 S.W. 803.\nSee also Ward v. State, 160 Texas Cr. Rep. 232, 268 S.W. 2d 465; and Evans v. State, 156 Texas Cr. Rep. 474, 243 S.W. 2d 843.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
