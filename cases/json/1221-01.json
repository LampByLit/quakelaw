Several objections were urged to this; it being in the absence of the defendant, was purely hearsay, improper, and because no fact which occurred in the grand jury room was in controversy.\nWe are of opinion that this exception is well taken under the authority of McKnight v. State, 50 Texas Crim. Rep., 252; 16 Texas Ct. Rep., 681. This very question was there discussed and decided adversely to the State, and in consonance with appellant’s contention.\nThe judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.\nReversed and remanded.",
