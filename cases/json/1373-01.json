In connection therewith the court further charged the jury that a conviction could not be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless corroborated by other evidence connecting the defendant with the offense charged and the corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the offense.\nThe court in its charge also submitted the issue of the voluntary character of appellant’s written statement.\nThe testimony of an accomplice witness together with the confession of the accused is sufficient to establish the corpus de-licti of an offense. Martinez v. State, 140 Texas Cr. Rep. 159, 140 S.W. 2d 187; Benjamin v. State, 160 Texas Cr. Rep. 624, 274 S.W. 2d 402.\nThe evidence is sufficient to support the conviction and no reversible error appearing the judgment is affirmed.\nOpinion approved by the Court.",
