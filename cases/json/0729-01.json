        "text": "were each charged by information with two counts of robbery in violation of Penal Code section 211, with two counts of kidnaping for the purpose of robbery in violation of Penal Code section 209, and defendant Ross was charged with, receiving stolen property in violation of Penal Code section 496. After a second trial by jury (following an initial mistrial because the jury was unable to' reach a verdict) each defendant was found \u201cguilty\u201d of both of the robbery counts and the degree was set as first; each defendant was found \u201cguilty\u201d of one but \u201cnot guilty\u201d of the other kidnaping for robbery count; and defendant Ross was found \u201cnot guilty\u201d of the count for receiving stolen property. The trial judge' reduced the guilty verdict of kidnaping for robbery to a violation of Penal Code section 207, as a lesser but necessarily included offense. Each defendant was sentenced to the state prison for the term prescribed by law on one of the robbery counts. The court stayed execution of judgment on the remaining two counte (robbery and kidnaping), such stays to become permanent upon the completion of time served under the robbery count. Both defendants filed timely notices, of appeal. However, defendant Ross did not file an opening brief, and we dismissed his appeal under rule 17(a) of the California Rules of Court on September 6, 1968. Defendant Hygh appeals from the judgment of conviction and from the denial of his motion for new trial.\nDefendant Hygh (hereinafter, defendant) raises a number of- legal arguments on appeal, which we take up seriatim with a concurrent exposition of the facts relevant to each argument.\n1. The prosecution\u2019s primary eyewitness was improperly \u201cprimed\u201d by the arresting officer before testifying. We conclude he was not.\nOn March 2, 1967, four Negro males entered a men\u2019s clothing store on Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles. One of them put a gun in the back of a salesman, Robert Jaeke, and ordered him and the store manager, Leon Marks, to lie face down on the floor. Both Jaeke and Marks obeyed. Then the man demanded that the manager open the back door. He did and returned to his prone position on the floor. This same man instructed Jaeke and Marks, \u201cKeep your head [sic] down or we\u2019ll blow your head [sic] off.\u201d Both Marks and Jaeke eould hear clothing being removed from the racks and carried through the rear door.\nAt the second trial, which is the consideration of this appeal, Jaeke testified that he was able to directly observe the man who had placed the gun at his back and had been the principal speaker for an accumulated time of 10 minutes, and he made an unequivocal court room identification of defendant as that man. On cross-examination, Jaeke testified that within a few days after the robbery (following two lineups wherein he was unable to identify anyone as a. potential suspect) he pointed out defendant from a group of 10 pictures. Upon further cross-examination, Jaeke revealed that before he had testified at the first trial the arresting officer, Sergeant Meckle, had showed him a photograph of defendant, apparently to refresh his recollection about his earlier out-of-court photographic identification. However, Jaeke stated that this had had no effect on him because ... I knew before. \u2019 \u2019 Jaeke also testified that Sergeant Meckle had further pointed out to him that defendant\u2019s hair style was different at the trial than at the time of the robbery. Again, Jaeke indicated that this had had no effect on him because \u201c. . . I could see that. \u2019 \u2019\nDefendant\u2019s contention must fail because he has not been able to demonstrate how the asserted \u201cpriming\u201d led to an unreliable identification a,t the second trial. There is absolutely no indication that the related circumstances might have been factors in Jaeke\u2019s identification of defendant, either at the first or second trial. (Cf. People v. Bolt, 265 Cal.App.2d 614, 615-616 [71 Cal.Rptr. 511].) Indeed, there is quite a bit of evidence to the contrary. Jaeke identified defendant from the group of photographs within a few days of the robbery. He denied that Sergeant Meckle\u2019s re-display of a picture of defendant prior to the first trial affected his judgment at the second trial. At the second trial he unequivocally identified defendant as one of th\u00e9 robbers. Defense counsel made use of a lengthy cross-examination of Jaeke to try to demonstrate his lack of ability to remember or his propensity to testify to something which was not within his memory. It is clear that the jurors believed that Jaeke\u2019s identification was accurate. We must allow them to be the sole judges of the witness\u2019 credibility and reliability. (People v. Alonzo, 158 Cal.App.2d 45, 47 [322 P.2d 42]; see also People v. Sanders, 217 Cal.App.2d 606, 610 [31 Cal.Rptr. 707].)\n2. The trial judge abused his discretion in denying defense counsel permission to use a particular \u201ctest , instance\u201d in the cross-examiiiation of the witness Jaeke. We conclude he did not.\nDuring the cross-examination of Jaeke, defense counsel attempted to utilize a \u201ctest instance,\u201d i.e., an in-court test of the witness\u2019 ability to observe and recollect a fact not material to the ease being tried but illustrative of his general ability to observe and to later recall and relate his observations. Jaeke was asked by defense counsel concerning his recollection as to who were the court personnel at the first trial. At one point, when he was being asked if he would stand by his statements, after Jaeke had stated as to the present court clerk\u2019s previous presence in court, \u201cI\u2019m not positive, but I think so,\u201d and again, \u201cI am quite sure about him but I am not positive,\u201d the trial judge interceded and directed defense counsel to desist from asking any more questions in this area on the ground that.the criteria (i.e., the particular \u201ctest instance\u201d) desired tobe used to measure the witness\u2019 ability to identify and recall was unfair and invalid, Defendant\u2019s counsel then made an offer of proof that the clerk of the first trial was a female Caucasian and that the current clerk was a male Negro. He argued that this evidence was highly probative on two defense points: 1) the inability' of the witness to accurately remember the identity of a person he had seen previously; and 2) his propensity to testify with considerable assurance that he remembered a fact when the average person in a similar circumstance would admit unequivocally that he was not positive. The trial judge explained, in effect, that he was not allowing use of the proposed \u201ctest instance\u201d on the ground that the question put to Jaeke was confusing, because there was an occasion other than the two trials on which Jaeke had been in court'when the current clerk had been on duty; that the question would not fairly test Jaeke\u2019s powers to observe and remember faces. Further, the trial judge felt that the court clerk in a trial was not someone that Jaeke. as a layman, would remember (compared with the robber in the store eommiting the crime in his presence) and that this further indicated that the proposed \u201ctest instance\u201d was inappropriate criteria to measure the witness\u2019 ability to observe and recollect.\nThe general rule in this area has been stated as follows: \u201c \u2018 The authorities all agree that wide latitude should be allowed in cross-examination for the purpose of testing accuracy or credibility[] especially if the witness is a reluctant one or is hostile, or if he is one of the parties in interest, or is a witness against a defendant in a criminal prosecution. The court has, however, discretionary power over cross-examination which will be disturbed on appeal only in case of an abuse thereof. Thus the court may confine an examination within reasonable limits, and irnaAf curtail a cross-examination which is unduly protracted, frivolous, or which relates to matters which are irrelevant, admitted or have already heen fully covered. (Emphasis added) \u2019 \u201d (People v. Whitehead, 113 Cal.App.2d 43, 43 [247 P.2d 717], quoting 27 Cal.Jur. 96 et seq.)\nConsidering the factors involved in the instant case, we cannot say, as a' matter of law, that the trial judge abused his discretion by not allowing defense counsel to ask further questions about the clerk and to prove the difference between the two clerks. \u2018\u2018 In proving the falsity of ... a test instance erroneously recollected . . . it is . . . common to exclude extrinsic testimony. Nevertheless, in simple cases, where the effect might be important this ought to be admitted. There is no propriety in a hard-and-fast rule; and the trial Court should be conceded a discretion.\u201d (3 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940) \u00a7 995, p. 638.)\n3. A confession and certain following admissions made by defendant to Sergeant Heckle were erroneously admitted into evidence because defendant\u2019s right to remain silent had been abused. We hold that there was no' error as to the confession and that any error as to the subsequent admissions was waived or was harmless.\nOn March 14, 1967, Sergeant Heckle and Officer Brown picked up defendant at the 77th Street police station to transport him to the Wilshire station pursuant to an arrest warrant. Sergeant Heckle advised appellant of his constitutional rights and asked him if he understood. Defendant said, \u201cYes.\u201d As they went out to the police vehicle, Sergeant Heckle asked him, \u201cDo you know why you have been busted?\u201d Defendant stated, \u201cYes, you\u2019ve got me, and I robbed the place, and I am guilty.\u201d Sergeant Heckle asked, \u201cWhat place?\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cThe clothing store.\u201d After naming the correct store involved, defendant stated, \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell you any details. I don\u2019t want to talk about it any more.\u201d Sergeant Heckle said, \u201cYou can\u2019t just tell me you are guilty and not tell me anything about it. I want some details. \u2019 \u2019 Sergeant Heckle then asked defendant if the gun he had used in the robbery was a revolver. Defendant said, \u201cYes\u201d and Sergeant Heckle asked him if it was the older style which breaks in half, to which defendant replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\nAt the outset, defendant waived his right to remain silent by indicating that he understood his right and then making a practical confession in response to the question as to whether he knew why he was \u201cbusted.\u201d He withdrew his waiver and reasserted his right when he said that he did not wish to talk any more. However, both Sergeant Heckle and Officer Brown were allowed to testify to the entire conversation. No objection was made by either defense counsel as to the second portion. Even though Miranda requires that all questioning must cease when a suspect has asserted his right to remain silent, it has uniformly been held that at a trial taking place after the rendition of Miranda an objection is a prerequisite to raising a violation issue on appeal. (People v. Richardson, 258 Cal.App.2d 23, 31 [65 Cal.Rptr. 487]; People v. Castro, 257 Cal.App.2d 643, 646 [65 Cal.Rptr. 62] ; People v. Taylor, 253 Cal.App.2d 574, 576 [61 Cal.Rptr. 638].) In any case the intitial statements made to the police officers under defendant\u2019s valid waiver were so incriminating that we can say beyond a reasonable, doubt that the subsequent admissions were harmlessly received. (Chapman v. California; 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710, 87 S.Ct. 824].) 4. Finally, defendant contends that we should now declare, as a matter of law, that a confession must be set down in writing and signed by the declarant, and, further, that it is not sufficient for such a confession to be orally repeated at trial by one police officer and corroborated by another. Defendant cites no eases in support of this contention. We are unable to find any. We make no such declaration.\nWhile the point is not raised on appeal, we feel compelled to discuss the effects on the instant case of our Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in People v. Daniels, 71 Cal.2d 1119 [80 Cal.Rptr. 897, 459 P.2d 225] (Crim. No. 10999, filed October 2, 1969). That case holds, inter alia, that where \u201cmovements of the victim are merely incidental to the commission of the robbery and do not substantially increase the risk of harm over and above that necessarily present in the crime of robbery itself\u201d section 209 of the Penal Code has not been violated. The holding in People v. Daniels is applicable to the case at bench. Defendant Hygh was found guilty of kidnaping Jaeke for the purpose of robbing him in addition to being found guilty of the first degree robbery of Jaeke. The kidnaping conviction was based on Hygh\u2019s act of forcing Jaeke at gunpoint to' move from the middle or front portion of the men\u2019s store to the rear and then to lie down on the floor. This asportation element was \u201cmerely incidental to\u201d the robbery and did not \u201csubstantially increase\u201d the potential for harm to Jaeke beyond that already created by the robbery itself. The trial judge reduced the crime to a violation of section 207 of the Penal Code' (simple kidnaping) obviously to avoid the harsher penalty provisions of section 209. Since there could have been no verdict of guilty of violation of Penal Code section 209, there could have been nothing to reduce to Penal Code section 207.\nThe holding in People v. Daniels requires a reversal of the kidnaping conviction. In all other respects the judgment is affirmed. The purported appeal from the denial of defendant\u2019s motion for new trial is dismissed.\nStephens, Acting P. J., and Chantry, J. pro tem., concurred.\nA petition for a rehearing was denied on November 6, 1969, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by Supreme Court was denied December 3, 1969.\nThere was no evidence that Hygh was in either of the lineups. On the contrary, there is a strong inference that he was not, because he was arrested after Jaeke had picked him out of the pictures.\nIn any case the change in hair style was extraneous information because 1) during the robbery defendant wore a hat, which completely covered his head, thereby removing hair style as an element of the identification; 2) the picture from which Jaeke made his identification showed defendant with the type of hair style he wore in court.\nSee discussion, infra, for source of this apt terminology.\nHis thought, no doubt, was that it would rather demonstrate Jaeke\u2019s ability, or inability, to understand to which instance defense counsel was referring.\nThe rationale is explained by Professor Wigmore: \u201cRepeated instances of inability to recollect give the right to doubt the correctness of an alleged recollection of a material fact; the force of the instances depending on the greater or less probability that the one thing could be forgotten while the other is remembered. \u2019 \u2019 (3 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940) \u00a7 995, p. 635.)\nMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444-445 [16 L.Ed.Sd 694, 706-707, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974].\nThe opinion of our Supreme Court in People v. Daniels, 71 Cal.2d 1119, 1139 [80 Cal.Rptr. 897, 459 P.2d 225], stresses that its interpretation of section 209 is what the Legislature always intended that it should be. In this light, what defendant Hygh did was never proscribed under section 209. This alteration in criminal accountability is quite a different matter than a judicial change in constitutional \"interpretation relating to police standards or prosecution practices and procedures (see discussion in People v. Edwards, 71 Cal.2d 1096, 1109-1110 [80 Cal.Rptr. 633, 458 P.2d 713]). Rather the issue is whether defendant can remain convicted for doing acts which at the time of his trial appeared to constitute the crime of kidnaping for the purpose of robbery (which the trial judge reduced to simple kidnaping) but which, today, while his case is still on direct review, clearly will not amount to a violation of that statutory section.' We think the most recently announced judicial construction of section 209 must be applied in this case. (See, e.g., People v. Villalobos, 245 Cal.App.2d 561 [54 Cal.Rptr. 60], which applies our Supreme Court\u2019s interpretational change in People v. Leal, 64 Cal.2d 504,511-512 [50 Cal.Rptr. 777, 413 P.2d 665] (quantum of narcotic required for possession) retroactively to a case then on appeal (so-called partial retroactivity) People v. Nigri, 232 Cal.App.2d 348 [42 Cal.Rptr. 679], which similarly followed the judicial change that' was pronounced in People v. Hernandez, 61 Cal.2d 529 [39 Cal.Rptr. 361, 393 P.2d 673, 8 A.L.R.3d 1092] (age mistake in statutory rape) ; see also language in People v. Rollins, 65 Cal.2d 681, 687-688, and footnote 3 at page 685 [56 Cal.Rptr. 293, 423 P.2d 221], which seems to be applicable to the instant situation, namely, \u201ceven a non-retroaetive judicial decision governs all cases which were not yet final when the decision was announced.\u201d (P. 688).) Because the posture of the instant ease does not require it, we do not concern ourselves with the question of whether the Daniels interpretation should be applied to eases in which judgment has already become final (so-called full retroactivity).\nRetired judge of the superior court sitting under assignment by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.",
