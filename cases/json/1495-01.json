Branch’s P.C., Sec. 498, p. 485. Nor does an affiant to a complaint have to be a witness to the transaction covered in the affidavit. Parnell v. State, 278 S.W. 2d 850.\nThe term “credible person,” as used in the statute, has reference to the competence of the affiant to testify for the state in the particular case in which the complaint is made. Branch’s P.C., 2d Edition, Sec. 499, p. 486. Whether one is a credible person within the meaning of the statute is not to be determined upon the truth or falsity of the statements contained in the complaint.\nThe complaint was not subject to the defect alleged.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
