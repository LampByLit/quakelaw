We have searched this record in vain and fail to find such requisite evidence from any other source.\nRecently, in Mitchell v. State, 166 Texas Cr. Rep. 291, 313 S.W. 2d 286, we had occasion to review this identical question and cited 27 cases from this court, covering the period from 1905 to 1951, which consistently hold that where the owner of the premises burglarized or the property taken testifies in the case, then lack of consent may not be proven by circumstantial evidence.\nIn addition to the cases there cited, appellant calls our attention to holdings in Mitchell v. State, 117 Texas Cr. Rep. 78, 38 S.W. 2d 331, and Dillard v. State, 126 Texas Cr. Rep. 292, 71 S.W. 2d 529, which also support the general rule announced in Mitchell v. State, 166 Texas Cr. Rep. 291, 313 S.W. 2d 286.\nAs opposed to this great weight of authority, the state relies upon Gonzalez v. State, 162 Texas Cr. Rep. 600, 288, S.W. 2d 503, which we have concluded does not support them. In that case, the owner of the premises testified that he did not give the appellant permission to enter the building, which we con-eluded carried with it a lack of consent to take anything therefrom.\nFor the failure of the state to make this essential proof, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.",
