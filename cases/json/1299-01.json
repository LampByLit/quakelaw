State, 161 Texas ,Cr. Rep. 599, 279 S.W. 2d 862. The fact which the appellant overlooks is that we held the evidence sufficient in Linsey even though there was no confession. In the case at bar, Bradfordâ€™s testimony clearly corroborated the appellantâ€™s confession, and we find the evidence sufficient to support the conviction.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
