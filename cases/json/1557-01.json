Appellant simply gave Mrs. Brown a check and stands convicted for violation of Art. 567b V.A.P.C. upon the jury’s finding that he gave the check with intent to defraud and thereby acquired a stock certificate for fifteen shares of stock in a corporation, knowing that he did not have sufficient funds in the bank to pay said check.\nWherever descriptive averments are made in an indictment, whether necessary or not, the proof must meet them as well as all necessary allegations, by corresponding evidence. Kahanek v. State, 83 Texas Cr. Rep. 19, 201 S.W. 994; Malone v. State, 135 Texas Cr. Rep. 169, 117 S.W. 2d 779.\nIn swindling cases the false pretense must be proved as alleged. If a different pretense from that alleged was the means by which the property was acquired there is a variance. King v. State, 158 Texas Cr. Rep. 98, 253 S.W. 2d 434; Branch’s Ann. P.C., 2d Ed., Sec. 2827.\nThe state availed itself of the prima facie evidence of the intent to defraud provision of Art. 567b V.A.P.C. arising from the non-payment of the check within ten days. Appellant paid Mrs. Brown the amount of the check, but not until after ten days following notice that it had not been paid by the bank, and after complaint had been filed.\nThe indictment having alleged that an oral false representation by appellant was made and relied upon, the state was required to prove such descriptive averment in order to convict.\nThe judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.",
