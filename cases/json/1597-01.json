The first conviction was in 1989; the second in 1950; the third when he went out on a bench warrant while serving the 1950 conviction; and the fourth in 1958. Following these convictions were the four in December, 1958, which are here being considered.\nThe court reduced the $10,000 appeal bond to $8,000 and reduced each of the three $7,500 appeal bonds to $5,000, making a total reduction of $9,500.\nWhen bail is substantially reduced on habeas corpus hearing, a showing by the accused of a reasonable effort to furnish bail in the reduced amount should be made before further complaint is urged that the amount remains excessive. Ex parte Burleson, 133 Texas Cr. Rep. 75, 109 S.W. 2d 200; Ex parte Dunlap, 166 Texas Cr. Rep. 55, 311 S.W. 2d 413.\nIn the absence of any further showing after the $9,500 reduction in the appeal bonds and under the record here presented there appears no abuse of discretion by the district judge.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nOpinion approved by the Court.",
