Ray Jackson, the injured party, arrived first and drank a few beers and danced a few times. Appellant, an acquaintance of Jackson, came in later.\nJackson took offense from a remark made by appellant and invited him outside. Appellant said â€œLetâ€™s go.â€\nThey proceeded outside and an argument ensued. Both appellant and Jackson had a beer bottle in their hands but no licks were passed and they were separated.\nAppellant re-entered the building. Jackson remained outside and sent word to appellant to meet him down the road. Appellant declined the invitation and remained in the building until closing-time, some fifteen minutes later.\nWhen appellant came out of the building Jackson was waiting, unarmed, and ready to fight.\nAn argument ensued and what to Jackson was a fist fight followed. Jackson was soon on the ground, appellant on top of him.\nJackson testified that appellant was â€œracking himâ€ on the back and shoulder, â€œwell, he just cut me in a racking manner, just slashed. He didnâ€™t stab me or nothing like that. He just gave me a slash. * * * I said â€˜You are cutting me; you are cutting me with a knife.â€™ * * * He said, â€˜No, Iâ€™m not going to quit; Iâ€™m going to kill you.â€™ â€\nJackson testified that he got ahold of appellantâ€™s hand and Joe Baker then separated thÃ©m. Jackson managed to hit appellant a time or two thereafter before appellant got in his car and left the scene. He was then taken to a hospital.\nDr. Allensworth, who examined and treated Jackson, described the wound in Jacksonâ€™s back as some 3i/2 inches in length and 5 inches in depth. He described Jacksonâ€™s condition as â€œgoing into a light shock,â€ and expressed the opinion that Jackson would have bled to death had he not received attention such as he received.\nA knife was found on the ground near the spot where the injury was inflicted.\nAppellant did not testify. A portion of his written statement to the district attorney was offered by the state in which he identified the knife found at the scene as the one he got out of his pocket and cut Jackson with.\nWe find the evidence sufficient to sustain the juryâ€™s verdict.\nIn his brief appellant complains of the overruling of his application for continuance based upon the absence of two witnesses, and the overruling of his motion for new trial because of the failure of the court to grant the continuance.\nNo affidavit of either absent witness, as to what his testimony would have been, is found in the record and there is no showing why such had not been secured and attached to the motion for new trial. In the absence of such the failure of the trial court to grant continuance does not call for reversal. Morris v. State, 158 Texas Cr. Rep. 516, 251 S.W. 2d 731; Gonzales v. State, 161 Texas Cr. Rep. 488, 278 S.W. 2d 167; Massoletti v. State, 165 Texas Cr. Rep. 20, 303 S.W. 2d 412.\nIt is next contended that the trial court erred in admitting in evidence a portion of appellantâ€™s confession because it was not shown to have been freely and voluntarily made.\nSuch an objection does not appear to have been made when the confession was offered. The trial court did not err in admitting it over the objection which was made.\nIt is contended that error is shown in the failure of the trial court to submit to the jury as an issue of fact whether the confession was voluntarily made.\nWe do not understand that such an issue was raised. If so, we find no exception to the courtâ€™s order overruling the objection to the courtâ€™s charge because of such omission; no requested charge and no bills of exception.\nThe judgment entered sets out the juryâ€™s verdict in which the punishment was assessed at eighteen months in the penitentiary, but adjudges that appellant be punished by confinement in the penitentiary for not less than one year nor more than eighteen months. The judgment is ordered reformed so as to conform to the verdict. The sentence appears regular.\nAs reformed, the judgment is affirmed.",

He started an argument with the appellant while they were in the beer tavern, during which time he invited appellant outside. His attack on the appellant at that time was stopped by bystanders. Appellant then went back into the building, at which time the injured party sent word for him to come back out and meet him down the road. Appellant de-dined to do so and remained inside the building\u0027 until closing time.\nAs appellant left the building, the injured party began attacking him again and, in final desperation, appellant was forced into the fight, in the course of which appellant cut the injured party with a knife.\nSo far as I am concerned, what appellant did was in self-defense. At least, his cutting the injured party was not with the specific intent to kill but for the purpose of cutting the injured party loose from him, which latter course appears to have been his only way out of the difficulty.\nI do not agree to putting this man in the penitentiary for doing what was forced upon him by his assailant, who was the injured party in this case.\nI therefore enter my dissent.",
