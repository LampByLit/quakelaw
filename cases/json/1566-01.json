We shall discuss the contentions advanced by the appellant in his brief.\nWe overrule appellantâ€™s contention that the verdict was fatally defective because it did not recite â€œupon a public highway.â€ Frazier v. State, 159 Texas Cr. Rep. 263, 262 S.W. 2d 501, and McGee v. State, 39 Texas Cr. Rep. 190, 45 S.W. 709.\nAppellant next seeks to complain about certain questions propounded to him on cross-examination. The statement of facts does not reveal that such questions were asked, nor do we find any bills of exception complaining of the same. These are the exclusive ways in which such a matter may be brought to this court for review. Article 759a, V.A.C.C.P.\nAppellantâ€™s last complaint relates to alleged jury misconduct. We need not pass upon the correctness of the ruling of the court in refusing to permit the jurors to swear to the statements which he sought to use in lieu of affidavits at the time they appeared as witnesses because the same do not show misconduct and were therefore insufficient as a pleading, and the action of the court in overruling the same at any stage of the proceeding could not be assigned as error. Barnett v. State, 160 Texas Cr. Rep. 622, 273 S.W. 2d 878. In this connection, attention is directed to the rule that a juror will not be permitted to impeach or explain his or her verdict by showing the reason for the conclusion reached. Bridges v. State, 166 Texas Cr. Rep. 556, 316 S.W. 2d 757, and cases there cited.\nFinding no reversible error, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.",
