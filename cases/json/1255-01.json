He sold a piano to one J. L. Yarbrough, taking therefor two notes and a horse. The notes, instead of being taken as his instructions required, in the name of the Hall Music Company, blank notes to this effect being furnished him, were in his own name, he scratching out â€œHall Music Company.â€ One of the notes was for $100, and the other for $50. As part payment for the piano he also received a horse, which horse he sold as the State insists without the knowledge or consent or authority of the Hall Music Company. Appellant insists that he had authority to sell the horse. Then, as suggested by the learned trial court, to rebut appellantâ€™s insistence, it was proper for the court to admit testimony of the sale of the notes taken contemporaneously with the taking of the horse in payment of the piano, as a circumstance to rebut the idea insisted upon by appellant as a defense; and the charge above very aptly covered the only reason and basis for a consideration of said testimony by the jury. Appellant was only indicted in this case for stealing a horse and certainly it was right to tell the jury that, if the fraudulent appropriation of the notes taken at the same time appellant took the horse could be a predicate for convicting him for embezzling the horse that such testimony was very pertinent to show his fraudulent intent in taking it.\nThe only other insistence in the motion for new trial is that the verdict of the jury is contrary to the law and the evidence. The testimony clearly supports the Stateâ€™s case. In fact, there can be no cavil over the question that appellant was guilty of a palpable embezzlement of his employerâ€™s horse.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nAffirmed.",
