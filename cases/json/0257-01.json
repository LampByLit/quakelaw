G. Palmer, and his liability insurer, Firemen\u2019s Insurance Company, to recover for personal injuries, medical expenses and property damages.\nFor the reasons assigned, the judgments of the district court and Court of Appeal are annulled and set aside, and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeal, Second Circuit, for the determination of the quantum of damages plaintiffs may be awarded under the facts of this case.",
