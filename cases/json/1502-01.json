You are instructed that whisky contains alcohol in excess of four percent by weight.â€\nAppellant urges that the record is silent as to whisky being sold and that the charge in effect instructed the jury that bourbon was whisky.\nAssuming that such was the effect of the courtâ€™s charge, we see no injury to appellant.\nâ€œBourbonâ€ used in describing a drink means whisky, the dictionary definition being â€œWhisky produced from corn in Bourbon County, Kentucky; hence, a similar whisky from a mash of corn only or chiefly corn.â€\nThe mixed drinks served the inspectors contained alcohol in excess of four per cent, under the chemistâ€™s testimony.\nWe find the evidence sufficient to sustain the conviction and no reversible error appears.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
