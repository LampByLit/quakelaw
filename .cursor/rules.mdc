# Lawyer Simulator Game - Conceptual Overview

## Core Game Concept
A lawyer simulator game based around a scheduling mechanic. The player plays as a lawyer who must manage their time, build cases, and present evidence in court. The game uses a calendar/time progression system where each day is 10 minutes of real time.

## Time & Calendar System

### Day Cycle
- **Day Length**: 10 minutes of real time = 24 hours in-game (00:00 to 00:00)
- **Start Time**: Each day begins at 07:00
- **Day Progression**: Time advances continuously from 07:00 through the day, evening, and night until 00:00 (midnight). Days are divided by midnights, however the player always wakes up at 07:00.
- **Next Day**: At 00:00, the day resets and the player wakes up at their bed at 07:00 the next day. The player can also trigger a new day before 07:00 by going to bed. 

### Week Structure
- **Sunday**: Game starts on Sunday
- **Monday**: Player has a mandatory meeting at law firm QLAW, receives a new case
- **Friday**: Player has a mandatory meeting at the courthouse to present evidence and make a statement to the judge
- **Weekend**: Saturday and Sunday are free days (no mandatory meetings)

## Mood System

### Mood States
The player can enter different moods based on their sleep/wake cycle:

1. **Normal Mood** (default)
   - Player is well-rested
   - Player is well-fed

2. **Tired Mood**
   - Triggered when player is awake for more than 18 consecutive hours
   - Adds an effect that munltiplies the player's speed by 0.5
   - Lasts until player sleeps in bed.

3. **Crazy Mood**
   - Triggered when player is awake for more than 48 consecutive hours
   - Adds an effect that munltiplies the player's speed by 0.5 
   - Lasts until player sleeps in bed.

4. **Hungry Mood** 
   - Triggered when player hasn't eaten for more than 18 consecutive hours. 
   - Adds an effect that munltiplies the player's speed by 0.5
   - Lasts until player consumes food. 

2. **Happy Mood**
   - Triggered when player has not entered a tired or crazy or hungry mood in more than 18 consecutive hours.
   - Adds an effect that munltiplies the player's speed by 1.5

3. **Drunk Mood**
   - Triggered when player consumes alcohol and has the Drunk effect.
   - Adds an effect that munltiplies the player's speed by 0.5
   - Adds subtle screen wobble effect. 

   3. **Wired Mood**
   - Triggered when player consumes crack and has the Wired effect.
   - Adds an effect that munltiplies the player's speed by 3.

### Sleep Mechanics
- Player must return to their bed to sleep
- Sleeping begins the next calandar day at 07:00.
- If player has not slept for more than 18 in game hours, they become Tired. After 48 hours, they become crazy. 

## World & Map

### Town Structure
- **Large town map** with at least 20 buildings
- **At least 25 NPCs** inhabiting the town
- NPCs have their own houses and schedules
- Buildings can be entered (interiors)

### Key Locations
- **Player's Bed/Home**: Starting location each day at 07:00
- **QLAW Law Firm**: Monday meeting location where cases are assigned
- **Courthouse**: Friday meeting location where evidence is presented
- **Other Buildings**: Various locations for gathering evidence, meeting NPCs, etc.

## NPC System

### NPC Behavior
- NPCs have their own houses
- NPCs follow their own schedules throughout the day
- NPCs move around the town according to their schedules
- NPCs can be interacted with (dialogue, information gathering, etc.)

## Case System

### Weekly Case Cycle
1. **Monday Morning**: Player attends meeting inside Current Firm (default is QLAW, located in QLAW building)
   - Receives a new case assignment
   - Case details provided

2. **Monday-Friday**: Player must build their case
   - Gather evidence
   - Interview witnesses/NPCs
   - Research case details
   - Schedule meetings
   - Complete tasks related to the case

3. **Friday**: Player attends meeting at courthouse
   - Presents all gathered evidence
   - Makes a statement to the judge
   - Judge makes decision (using AI - DeepSeek API)

### Case Sources
- Cases are based on real cases gathered from the internet
- Cases provide the narrative framework for each week

## AI Integration

### DeepSeek API Usage
- **Judge Decisions**: AI simulates the judge's decision based on:
  - Evidence presented
  - Player's statement
  - Case details
- **Other Mechanics**: AI may be used for other game mechanics (TBD)

## Gameplay Mechanics (Current State)

### Retained from Original Game
- **Boomerang**: Player retains boomerang mechanics (for now)
- **Health System**: Health mechanics remain
- **Enemies**: Enemy system exists but enemies are removed from levels for now

### Core Activities
- **Scheduling**: Player must manage their time and schedule meetings
- **Task Completion**: Complete various tasks throughout the day
- **Evidence Gathering**: Collect evidence for cases
- **NPC Interaction**: Talk to NPCs, gather information
- **Time Management**: Balance sleep, work, and case preparation

## Technical Architecture

### Engine Foundation
- Built on existing game engine (gameEngine.js)
- Uses GameObject system for entities
- Tile-based level system (repurposed for town/building layout)
- Physics and collision system
- Rendering pipeline with shadows

### Game State
- Day/time tracking
- Calendar system (day of week, date)
- Mood state tracking
- Case progress tracking
- Evidence inventory
- NPC schedules and states

## Development Philosophy
- **Simplest is best**: Keep implementations simple and straightforward
- **Methodical approach**: Build one piece at a time
- **Iterative development**: Add features incrementally
- **Maintain existing systems**: Keep working systems (boomerang, health) until replacement is ready

## Future Considerations
- Remove combat mechanics when scheduling/interaction systems are complete
- Replace procedural maze generation with town layout
- Expand mood system effects
- Add more NPC interaction depth
- Expand case variety and complexity
- Add more buildings and locations
- Enhance AI integration for more dynamic gameplay
