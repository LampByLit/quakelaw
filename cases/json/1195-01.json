See Covington v. State, 52 Texas Crim. Rep.; 19 Texas Ct. Rep., 55; Stephens v. State, 97 S. W. Rep., 483; Goen v. State, 101 S. W. Rep., 232.\nIn his motion for a new trial appellant insists that the court erred in overruling defendantâ€™s plea to the jurisdiction of the court, and contends that the terms of court fixed by the commissioners court, was not in compliance with the Constitution, to wit: Article 5, section 29, and with the provisions of chapter 4, title 29 of the Bevised Statutes. The Constitution and the statutes provide that the commissioners court shall fix the terms of the county court and that these terms shall not be changed until after the expiration of a year. An inspection of the orders of the commissioners court, as embodied in the bill of exceptions, shows that in 1904, the commissioners court of Graj^son County fixed five terms of the court per year for that county, and that in May, 1907, they added another term of court, which made six terms a year. The bill does not show how or in what manner these orders were violative of either the Constitution or the statute. This case was tried at a term of the court fixed by the commissioners court in 1904, and the term as fixed by the commissioners court of 1907, did not change said term. We find no merit in the complaint of appellant.\nAppellant insists that the charge is upon the weight of the evidence. We have carefully read the same and do not believe there is any merit in appellantâ€™s contention. The charge of the court is a proper and apt presentation of the law of this case.\nNor do we think there was any error in permitting the witness to make a detailed statement of all the facts and declarations of the parties at the time the whisky was purchased, said acts and declarations being contemporaneous and part and parcel of the res gestae of the transaction.\nFinding no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.\nAffirmed.",
