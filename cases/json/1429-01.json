He further testified that before leaving Crystal City for Mexico the appellant put six bottles of beer in the automobile ; that he drank two and the appellant the rest; that when they returned to Crystal City they went to appellantâ€™s cafe, got three bottles of beer, drove to a gin where he drank one and the appellant two bottles.\nCity Marshal J. P. English, upon being called as a witness by the state, testified that on the date alleged, in response to a call, he went to the junior high school in Crystal City where he found a Club 45 Mexican whiskey bottle containing some liquor in a bar ditch and that he later found Jose Coronado north of the school in a drunken condition and arrested him; that within an hour he talked to the appellant and in the conversation the appellant admitted taking Coronado to Mexico, and bringing the whiskey back but stated that â€œJoe Frank had stolen it from him. That he had not given it to him.â€\nAs a witness in his own behalf, appellant admitted taking Coronado with him on the trip to Mexico where they drank some beer and each bought a bottle of whiskey but denied having taken any beer in the automobile or consuming any beer after they returned. He testified that he asked Coronado his age to which he replied, eighteen years old; that he looked like he was older than eighteen, and that when they passed through customs, Coronado told the officials he was eighteen years of age.\nWe have concluded that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction.\nThe conviction cannot be sustained upon the testimony of the accomplice witness Coronado as to his drinking the beer which he testified appellant put in the automobile before leaving Crystal City for Mexico and drinking the beer at the gin after their return to Crystal City as there is no other evidence in the record whatsoever corroborating his testimony.\nIf there was any offense committed in connection with the drinking of beer by Coronado in the Republic of Mexico it did not occur in Zavala County, Texas, as charged in the complaint and information, and therefore cannot support the conviction.\nThe only evidence in the record which tends to corroborate Coronadoâ€™s testimony that appellant gave him the whiskey which he testified he drank is the circumstance of finding the empty whiskey bottle and Coronado in an intoxicated condition. These circumstances are as consistent with Coronado having stolen the whiskey as with the whiskey having been given to him.\nThe state, having introduced in evidence the exculpatory statement of appellant that Joe Frank (or Jose) Coronado stole the whiskey, and he (appellant) did not give it to him was bound thereby until it was shown to be untrue by other evidence. The only evidence disproving such statement is found in the testimony of Coronado, the accomplice witness.\nThe conclusion is expressed that the evidence is insufficient to corroborate the testimony of the accomplice witness or to sustain the conviction.\nAppellantâ€™s motion for rehearing is granted, the order of affirmance is set aside and the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.\nOpinion approved by the Court.",
