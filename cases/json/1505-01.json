The appeal is reinstated.\nProsecution was upon complaint and information.\nThe state concedes that the complaint is fatally defective for the reason that the date the offense is alleged to have been committed cannot be ascertained from a reading thereof. It appears to be “on or about the 11th day of October, A.D., 57.”\nThe complaint is not sufficient to support the information which alleges the date of the offense as “on or about October 11, A.D., 1957.” Suzuki v.
