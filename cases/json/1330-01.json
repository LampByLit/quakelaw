The affidavit of the Appellantâ€™s probation officer alleged violations of standard conditions of probation numbers 1, 2, 7 and 9, as well as a special condition of probation pertaining to a fine and court costs.\nAfter reviewing the Record on Appeal and the appellate briefs filed in the case, this Court is of the opinion that the trial courtâ€™s revocation of the Appellantâ€™s probation is supported by competent, substantial evidence that the Appellant violated the special condition of probation and standard conditions 2 and 9. Therefore, the Appellantâ€™s Judgment and Sentence are AFFIRMED.\nDATE OF DECISION OCTOBER 3, 1991.\nThe trial courtâ€™s determination that the Appellant violated standard condition 1 requiring that the Appellant procure the consent of his probation officer prior to changing his residence is erroneous, inasmuch as the Appellant had no control over his whereabouts while incarcerated.",
