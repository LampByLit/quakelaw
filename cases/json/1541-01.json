This is an appeal from said order.\nCounsel for appellant represents that he will be compelled to abandon his appeal from the conviction for sale of marijuana if his client is required to remain in jail, in order to save his life, there being adequate facilities in the Texas Department of Correction for his treatment and care. He relies upon Art. 137 C.C.P.\nIt has been held that â€œlegal custodyâ€ referred to in Art. 137 C.C.P. does not contemplate release after conviction of a felony. Ex parte Smith, 64 S.W. 1052.\nThere is no showing in this record that an appeal has been taken in the marijuana case. No such appeal is found on this courtâ€™s records.\nIf so, Art. 815 C.C.P. requires that appellant remain in custody in order for this court to have jurisdiction of the appeal. If that case is still pending on the docket of the trial court, then Art. 699 C.C.P. requires that the defendant shall remain in custody to await the further action of the court.\nAnother rule here applicable is stated in Ex parte Shacklett, 156 Texas Cr. Rep. 217, 241 S.W. 2d 849: â€œWhere the confinement is after conviction, it must be shown that any confinement would endanger the life of the prisoner before he is entitled to release.â€\nThe trial judgeâ€™s order remanding appellant was authorized .under the authorities above cited.\nOur holding does not preclude appellantâ€™s safekeeping by the Texas Department of Correction pending an appeal from his conviction for possessing marijuana, should the trial judge so order.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
