The proof further shows that on the day before, he borrowed $5 from Scott and agreed to bring his pistol to Scottâ€™s house as a pledge for security for the money; that he didnâ€™t bring it on the evening when he promised to and he was reminded on the next day to bring it. That he went home and got the pistol and was on the direct route to Scottâ€™s house with the pistol; that he stopped on the way and talked with a party and while there another person, to wit: Jim Coleman came up and he and appellant had an altercation and appellant shot Coleman with the pistol. He then went home with the pistol, not carrying it to Scottâ€™s house. This is a sufficient statement of the case to present appellantâ€™s assignments.\nOn this state of facts appellant contends that the court should have given his special requested instruction, as follows, to wit:\n\"If by previous arrangement between the defendant and Cal Scott the defendant was to deliver to said Scott a pistol owned by the defendant, and on the day he was alleged to have carried the pistol he was requested or instructed by said Scott to carry the pistol to Scottâ€™s house, and if at the time he was seen with the pistol he was carrying it to Scottâ€™s house or on the way from his house to Scottâ€™s house on the usually traveled route, then he would not be guilty of unlawfully carrying a pistol and you will acquit him.â€\nAn examination of the courtâ€™s charge shows that this defense set up by appellant, was not given by tire learned judge who tried the case. We think it was a legitimate defense and that the\u0027 jury should have had the right to have passed on it.\nFor the refusal of the court to give said requested instruction the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.\nReversed and remanded.\nDavidson, Presiding Judge, absent.",
