A. Bradley, Jr. testified that he and his father owned the Bradley Motor \u0026 Armature Works as a partnership and that he was “in control and possession of the business” and operated it as manager, that when the check in question was returned he made several efforts to get in touch with the appellant and wrote to him, but was unable to find him and received no reply to his letter until shortly before the trial, and that the check had not been paid.\nSam Bradley testified that he was sales engineer for the Bradley Motor \u0026 Armature Works, that he made a trip in an effort to locate the appellant but was unable to do so and finally turned the check over to the district attorney’s office.\nIt was shown that the appellant had no account in the bank on which the check was drawn.\nAppellant did not testify in his own behalf, but called his wife who testified that they had resided at Mathis for a number of years and that the appellant operated a lumber yard and drive-in-grocery.\nBy brief, appellant asserts that a fatal variance exists because the indictment charged that the appellant took the motor from V. A. Bradley, Jr. while the proof showed that it was Williamson who made the sale, and relies upon McGinty v. State, 93 Texas Cr. Rep. 160, 245 S.W. 924. In McGinty, the check was given one Mangum who was “in charge” of the Pure Food Grocery. From the above statement of the case, it is apparent that the only evidence on the subject was that V. A. Bradley, Jr. was in control of the business.\nIn Whitaker v. State, 85 Texas Cr. Rep. 272, 211 S.W. 737, we said, “There is no attempt to show that Coffee (to whom the check was given) was the special owner, and had exclusive possession, control, and management of the property, but as an employee of the Stewart Products Company he took their money and cashed this check.” This court held that ownership should not, under such facts, have been alleged in Coffee.\nThough not free from question, we have concluded that under this record possession was properly charged in Bradley.\nAppellant next contends that the record does not reflect any false pretext made by the appellant. In Dixon v. State, 152 Texas Cr. Rep. 504, 215 S.W. 2d 181, this court said:\n“Verbal assertions or direct representations are not required to show a false pretense or representation. Such may be shown by the conduct and acts of the party. Wharton’s Criminal Law, Vol. 2, Sec. 1436, p. 1727, 22 Am. Jur., p. 455, Sec. 19; Blum v. State, 20 Texas App. 578, 54 Am. Rep. 530; Brown v. State, 37 Texas Cr. Rep. 104, 38 S.W. 1008.”\nSee also Branch’s Ann. P.C., 2nd Ed., Vol. 5, Sec. 2827, p. 343.\nFinding no reversible error, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.",
