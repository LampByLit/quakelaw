      {
        "text": "instituted by Alice J. Klinger against defendant, Andrew M. Henderson, M.D., for injuries sustained by Mrs. Klinger from a hysterectomy. After jury trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of defendant, and judgment was entered accordingly. The trial judge granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial, first, on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to justify the verdict, and, second, because an error of law occurred when he gave a misleading instruction in connection with the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\nOn May 21, 1962, plaintiff went to Dr. L. W. Merrill, Jr., a general practitioner in Sacramento, for a physical examination. A smear test and a subsequent biopsy confirmed the presence of cancer of the cervix. However, the pathologist\u2019s report indicated the possibility that the malignancy had been completely removed by the biopsy. Nevertheless, Dr. Merrill referred plaintiff to Dr. Henderson, a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology. Defendant recommended a hysterectomy calling for the removal of the entire uterus, including the cervix, the right tube and ovary. There is no issue as to the wisdom of this recommendation.\nDefendant performed the recommended hysterectomy at the Sutter Community Hospital in Sacramento, with Dr. Merrill\u2019s assistance. During the course of the operation defendant entered the vagina from the top and proceeded to cut first around the side in order to separate it from the uterus. As he cut around the left side, there was marked bleeding from a branch of the uterine artery, which obscured the operative field and hid the bleeding vessel from view. Defendant grasped where he thought the bleeding vessel was and caught it; he clamped and ligatured the bleeding artery. Defendant completed the operation without apparent complications. Sometime later plaintiff developed a ureter vaginal fistula, causing severe pain and discomfort and necessitating 'corrective surgery; the ureter is a tube several inches long running from the' kidney to the bladder, and a ureter vaginal fistula is an opening between the ureter and the vagina.\nAt the trial, defendant testified that he believed that the injury to Mrs. Klinger\u2019s ureter was caused by accidental clamping, suturing or kinking when the uterine artery was clamped and ligatured to stop the profuse bleeding. This testimony as to the nature of the injury was corroborated by Dr. W. E. Jones and Dr. L. M. Boyers, both specialists in obstetrics and gynecology. Dr. Jones opined that in clamping and tying the bleeding artery the blood supply to the ureter was interfered with or a kinking or compression of the ureter occurred. Dr. Boyers said that in his opinion the injury resulted from angulations and tensions on the ureter which occurred when Dr. Henderson ligated the bleeding vessel.\nTurning first to the court\u2019s order granting plaintiff a new trial on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to justify the jury\u2019s verdict, it is clear that the order not only complies with section 657 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended in 1965, but also demonstrates that the trial judge\u2019s action was \u201cthe.-product of a mature and. careful reflection.\u201d [Mercer v. Perez, 68 Cal.2d 104, 113 [65 Cal.Rptr. 315, 436 P.2d 315].) The judge\u2019s specification of reasons reads as follows: \u201cThe defendant testified that he damaged the plaintiff\u2019s left ureter while performing, the hysterectomy, but he did not actually know how the injury occurred. During the operation he encountered marked bleeding which obscured his operative field. He could not see the bleeding vessel, since it may have retracted somewhat, and so, using a clamp, he \u2018blindly grasped\u2019 where he thought the vessel was. In his opinion the damage to the ureter was done when he clamped the bleeder, possibly because the clamp was placed on the ureter.\n\u201cDr. Boyers, a defense witness, testified on direct examination that when confronted with a bleeding artery the surgeon has. \u2018many guides\u2019 to the location of the bleeder. He listed touch, seeing the pulsation of the artery, or seeing the origin of the bleeding. He contraindicated \u2018blind clamping.\u2019\"\n\u201cDr. Jones, another defense witness, testified on direct examination even more explicitly: that when confronted with a bleeder the surgeon stops the bleeder with his finger and \u2018then clamps. \u2019 On cross-examination he reiterated that the surgeon should feel for the loose end of the artery but should not \u2018go blind with a clamp. \u2019\n\u2018 \u2018 The defendant excused his blind clamping by the \u2018 extenuating circumstances, \u2019 i.e., the necessity of stopping the flow of blood. But it appears from the uncontradicted testimony of his own witnesses that he violated the ordinary techniques of the profession by clamping blindly. The court concludes, therefore, that the verdict, which imports finding that the defendant proceeded with due care, is not supported by the evidence.\u201d Thus, we must look to the record to determine whether the judge\u2019s reasons for granting a new trial on this ground are supported by the evidence (Mercer v. Perez, supra). We shall bear in mind that on a motion for a new trial the trial judge may disbelieve witnesses, reweigh the evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom contrary to those of the trier of fact (Ridge v. Calabrese Supply Co., 263 Cal.App.2d 546 [69 Cal.Rptr. 844]). We shall also bear in mind that all presumptions are in favor of the order and that we must not disturb the ruling unless a manifest and unmistakable abuse of discretion is made to appear (Yarrow v. State of California, 53 Cal.2d 427 [2 Cal.Rptr. 137, 348 P.2d 687]: Mazzotta v. Los Angeles Ry. Corp., 25 Cal.2d 165 [153 P.2d 338]).\nOur independent review of the evidence impels the conclusion that the trial judge had sufficient basis to believe that defendant was negligent in the manner that he clamped the bleeding branch of the uterine artery and that this negligence was the proximate cause of the injury to Mrs. Klinger\u2019s ureter. The medical testimony is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation that defendant \u201cblindly\u201d clamped the bleeding branch of plaintiff\u2019s uterine artery, and that in doing so he did not exercise the degree of skill and learning required of a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology nor did he follow the ordinary procedures and techniques of his profession as practiced in the Sacramento area (Inouye v. Black, 238 Cal. App.2d 31, 33 [47 Cal.Rptr. 313, 14 A.L.R.3d 961]; Lamb v. Moore, 178 Cal.App.2d 819, 823 [3 Cal.Rptr. 507]). Dr. Boyers and Dr. Jones testified that the clamping of a bleeding vessel without locating the \u201cbleeder\u201d by sight or by feel with the hand (clamping blindly) is contraindicted because of the danger of injury to other structures such as the ureter. Both witnesses stated that when the surgical field is obscured by blood and cannot be cleared by mopping or suction, the correct procedure is to look for the source of the spurting blood or feel with the hand for the pulsating artery and to close off the flow with the finger. Yet, despite the medical opinion as to the danger of \u201cclamping blindly\u201d and despite the medical techniques developed to obviate this danger, defendant testified as follows: \u201cWell, as I cut across the left angle of the vagina there was profuse bleeding, and I saw the end of the vessel momentarily, asked for a clamp, by the time I got a clamp in my hand the field was obscured with blood, I tried to put pressure on it, this wasn\u2019t successful, I had seen exactly where it was 'coming from, and I felt that I could put a clamp on it and stop the bleeding, so I put the clamp on the side of the- vagina right at the area where I thought that bleeder was, and the bleeding stopped, we mopped up. \u2019 \u2019\nDefendant argues that in arriving at his decision, the trial judge relied on isolated portions of his testimony. He asserts that when he testified that -he \u201cblindly grasped\u201d where he thought the bleeder was coming from, he was not using the word \u201cblind\u201d in the same context used by Dr. Jones and Dr. Boyers. Defendant explains that when he used the term \u201cblind\u201d he meant only that his vision was obscured, and did not mean that he did not use one of the approved techniques described by the medical experts. He concludes that when his testimony is viewed as a whole, it is clear that he used an approved technique because he said that he saw the end of the bleeder momentarily and, although it went out of his vision, he saw 11 exactly where it was coining from\u201d and clamped at this spot.\nAdmittedly, defendant\u2019s arguments are persuasive. However, they are not 'conclusive at the appellate level. While it may be true that his testimony, when viewed as a whole, is susceptible to the interpretation contested for, it is also susceptible to the interpretation given to it by the trial judge. Defendant said that he \u201cblindly grasped the . . . where I thought this bleeder was coming from. \u2019 \u2019 He also said that he saw the end of the vessel momentarily, but by the time he got the clamp in his hand the view was obscured with blood. Defendant added that he \u201chad seen exactly where it was coming from\u201d so he put the clamp \u201cright at the area where [he] thought the bleeder was. ...\u201d And, significantly, Dr. Jones stated that an injury to the ureter was never justified. We cannot hold that it was a manifest abuse of discretion for the trial judge to grant a new trial on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to justify the verdict.\nIn view of the possibility of another trial, we turn next to the question of whether the trial judge erred when hv modified the standard jury instruction on the doctrine of re* ipsa loquitur (BAJI 214-W) to read as follows:\n\u201cYou must decide the following questions concerning tin-injury involved in this case.\n\u201cIs it the kind of injury which ordinarily does not occur in the absence of negligence ?\n\u201cWhether the injury is one which ordinarily does not occur in the absence of negligence is to be determined from the evidence presented in this trial by physicians and surgeons called as expert witnesses, including the evidence given by the defendant.\n\u201c The mere fact that a particular injury does not ordinarily result from a hysterectomy does not, in and of itself, prove that it was caused by negligence.\n\u201cIf, and only if, you find that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was of a kind which ordinarily does not occur in the absence of negligence, you are instructed as follows:\n\u201cFrom the happening of the injury involved in this case, an inference may be drawn that a proximate cause of the occurrence was some negligent conduct on the part of the defendant.\u201d (Italics added.)\nIn the leading case of Siverson v. Weber, 57 Cal.2d 834 [22 Cal.Rptr. 337, 372 P.2d 97], the California Supreme Court held that if the evidence merely proves that a patient has suffered an unfortunate result which rarely occurs from a hysterectomy, it is not sufficient to establish negligence on the part of the operating surgeon nor does it warrant the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. The court at page 839 stated: \u201cTo permit an inference of negligence under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur solely because an uncommon complication develops would place too great a burden upon the medical profession and might result in an undesirable limitation on the use of operations or new procedures involving an inherent risk ,of injury even when due care is used.\u201d If the evidence in this case had proved only that Mrs. Klinger had suffered a vaginal fistula and that vaginal fistulas rarely occur from a hysterectomy, plaintiff would not have been entitled to any instruction on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. As we have seen, the medical evidence proved that the vaginal fistula was caused by a kinking or compression of the ureter which occurred when defendant clamped the bleeding branch of the uterine artery. Moreover, as we have stated, the medical testimony was reasonably susceptible to the interpretation that such an injury rarely occurs in the absence of some negligence on the part of the operating surgeon. The trial judge therefore properly gave a conditional instruction on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur (Gerhardt v. Fresno Medical Group, 217 Cal.App.2d 353 [31 Cal.Rptr. 633]). But, since there was also substantial evidence that vaginal fistulas rarely occur from hysterectomies, the court gave a \u201cmere fact\u201d instruction to prevent the jury from finding defendant guilty of negligence solely because of the rarety of the occurrence.\nThe crucial question, therefore, is whether the \u201cmere fact\u201d instruction which the trial judge gave as a part of the res ipsa loquitur instruction, without explanation or clarification, was misleading. We conclude that it was. The trial judge told the jury that if they found that plaintiff\u2019s injury is \u201cthe kind of injury which ordinarily does not occur in the absence of negligence, \u2019 \u2019 they could draw an inference \u2018 \u2018 that a proximate cause of the occurrence was some negligent conduct on the part of the defendant.\u201d However, in almost the same breath, the judge also told the jury that \u201cthe mere fact that a particular injury does not ordinarily result from a hysterectomy does not, in and of itself, prove that it was caused by negligence. \u2019 \u2019 Then, he informed the jury 1 \u2018 if and only if, you find that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was of a kind which ordinarily does not occur in the absence of negligence, you are instructed as follows. ...\u201d Without an appropriate explanation which would have enabled the jury to properly correlate and reconcile the two instructions, it is possible that they were confused and even misled. (See Guerra v. Handlery Hotels, Inc., 53 Cal.2d 266 [1 Cal.Rptr. 330, 347 P.2d 674].) As the court aptly stated in Getas v. Hook, 236 Cal.App.2d 705, 713 [46 Cal.Rptr. 249], with reference to the giving of a \u201cmere fact of the accident\u201d instruction in conjunction with the res ipsa loquitur instruction: \u201c. . . where there is evidence warranting the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur but it' is not applicable as a matter of law, it is recognized that where both instructions are given without an explanation, an order granting a new trial should be affirmed;. . . \u201d\nThe order is affirmed.\nStone, P. J., concurred.\nFor example, Dr. Jones testified:\n\u201cQ. Then if you run into some sort of a bleeder, if it is not too severe, you can just suction it out and then clamp and ligate it, is that right?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And if it happens to be severe, you stop everything you are doing and get that bleeder?\nA. Correct.\nQ. But you exercise care when you are getting the bleeder, don\u2019t you?\nA. Yes.\nQ. You don\u2019t go wild with a ligature before you have even located or identified the bleeder, do you?\nA. No.\nQ. No. Now you indicated to Mr. Bonnington that if you can see the bleeder, you put a clamp on it?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And if you can\u2019t see it, you get your hand in there and fish around to find it, squeeze it off, is that right?\nA. Yes. Or you use the sponges or the suction. I mentioned whatever means that you feel are best calculated to control the bleeding tempo-rarily.\nQ. So you would have, then, those, three cases; if you can see it, you clamp it, if you can\u2019t see it, you either suction it out or mop it up, or you go in by hand?\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right. Now, the reason you would use your hand, I suppose, is because then you can feel what you are running into\u2014\nA. To some degree.\nQ. And then you can tell when you do grab the bleeder, that you will have a notion that you have probably got the bleeder and, say, not the bladder?\nA.
