The driver of the other car pleaded guilty. The result of the charge against Mrs. Hunter is not disclosed.\nIn addition to the testimony of the investigating officers who described appellant’s appearance and demeanor and the odor of alcohol about him, and expressed the opinion that he was intoxicated, an examination of a sample of appellant’s blood taken with his consent some two hours after the collision showed an alcoholic content of .31 per cent, .15 per cent or more being the accepted standard indicating intoxication, according to the testimony of the chemist. The evidence is sufficient to sustain the jury’s verdict.\nNo brief has been filed in appellant’s behalf pointing to errors and we find none warranting reversal.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
