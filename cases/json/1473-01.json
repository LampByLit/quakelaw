State, 159 Texas Cr. Rep. 602, 266 S.W. 2d 875, we had before us a comparable situation and, in reversing the conviction, said:\nâ€œAppellant filed an application for a suspended sentence and testified as a witness in his own behalf. His reputation was therefore put in issue. Under well-established rules of evidence the state was entitled to show that his general reputation as a peaceable and law-abiding citizen was bad, and also to prove recent convictions for felony offenses or offenses involving moral turpitude, if such proof was available.\nâ€œBut collateral acts of misconduct not resulting in charges filed (and under the present statute, Art. 782a, Vernonâ€™s Ann C.C.P., in conviction), or convictions for misdemeanors not involving moral turpitude are not generally admissible. Pena v. State, 246 S.W. 2d 478; Mitchell v. State, 239 S.W. 2d 384; Clements v. State, 169 S.W. 2d 190.\nâ€œThe state offered no proof of the bad general reputation of appellant. But on his cross-examination, appellant having admitted that he had the knife in his pocket, the state was permitted to show that after he had had â€˜previous knifing troubleâ€™ the sheriff ordered appellant not to carry a knife and he promised he would not.â€\nSee also Davis v. State, 168 Texas Cr. Rep. 138, 268 S.W. 2d 152; Rodriguez v. State, 160 Texas Cr. Rep. 453, 272 S.W. 2d 366; and Parrish v. State, 163 Texas Cr. Rep. 252, 290 S.W. 2d 245.\nFor the error pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.",
