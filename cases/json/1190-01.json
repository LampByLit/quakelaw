Subdivision 3 of article 673 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, provides, as ground for challenge of any juror in a criminal case, â€œthat he has been convicted of theft or any felony.â€ Article 676 of the Code of Criminal Procedure contains the following provision: â€œHo juror shall be empaneled Avhen it appears that he is subject either to the third, fourth or fifth clause of challenge in article 673, although both parties may consent.â€ The disqualification contained in subdivision 3 of article 673 has been held to be absolute. See Greer v. State, 14 Texas Crim. App., 179. The only departure from this rule, ever authorized by this court, was in a case where a convict had been pardoned by the governor, and where the pardon removed his disabilities of citizenship. See Easterwood v. State, 34 Texas Crim. Rep., 400.\nAs presented in this record, it is clear the case must be reversed for the reason stated, and it is accordingly so ordered.\nReversed and remanded.",
