There is no showing in this record as to the laws of New Mexico. It therefore follows that it is not shown that relator is substantially charged in the demanding state with a crime under the laws of that state as is required by Section 3 of Article 1008a, V.A.C.C.P.\nThe judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.",
