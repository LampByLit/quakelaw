Nowlin v. State, 149 Texas Cr. Rep. 563, 197 S.W. 2d 350, and cases cited under Article 666, V.A.C.C.P., Note 44.\nThe injured partyâ€™s testimony as to the extent of his injuries showed serious bodily injury and was sufficient to support the conviction for aggravated assault.\nFinding no reversible error, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.",
