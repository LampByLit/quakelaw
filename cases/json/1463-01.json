The statement of facts approved by counsel makes no mention of the type of business in which the appellant is engaged, and we cannot consider allegations in the brief not supported by the statement of facts.\nWe have been presented no argument which would cause us to overrule the prior holdings of this court on Sayeg v. State, 114 Texas Cr. Rep. 163, 25 S.W. 2d 865, and the cases there cited, to the effect that the articles which comprise Chapter Two of Title 7, V.A.P.C. (Sunday Laws), are constitutional. The contention that conditions have changed would be more compelling were it not for the fact that the legislature of this state has amended the provisions of such chapter six times since the original adoption.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
