        "text": "Ingraham, J.:\nThe defendant was indicted for the murder of one Louisa Smith. There was evidence that the defendant and the deceased had been living together for some years prior to the 9th of February, 1904; that a few days prior to February 9, 1904, the deceased left the defendant, and on the morning of February ninth was with her sister, who lived in a tenement house in West Forty-first street with a man named Brooks, who was in the defendant\u2019s employ; that on the morning of February ninth the defendant with two companions took Brooks, who was drunk, to the rooms in which Brooks lived with the deceased\u2019s sister; that in trying to take Brooks to his room, the defendant having become covered with filth, he left Brooks on, the stairs and went into a room where the deceased and her \u25a0sister were in bed; that the defendant requested the sister of the deceased to \u201c wash him off \u201d and took off his coat and vest; that the sister of the deceased washed him, gave him another shirt, which he put on and walked back into the room where the \u25a0deceased was in bed, leaving the sister of the deceased in the kitchen; that in the meantime the deceased had got up and partly dressed herself.\nThe -sister of the deceased, called for the People, testified that the defendant walked back to the parlor, grabbed the deceased by her arm and said, \u201c Are you going to give me those rings ? \u201d that the deceased did not make any reply and walked on to the bedroom; that the defendant followed the deceased into the bedroom, when he grabbed her by the arm again, and the deceased said, \u201c Don\u2019t, Tom, you hurt; \u201d that the witness said, \u201c You children want to stop playing in there,\u201d to which the defendant replied, \u201c I am not playing,\u201d and the deceased then sat down on the edge of the bed, when the defendant said,\nAre you going to give me those rings ? \u201d that the deceased made no reply, when the defendant took a pistol out of his pocket and said, \u201c Take that,\u201d and discharged the pistol, inflicting the wound which subsequently resulted in her death. After the shooting the police were called in and the deceased was taken to the hospital.\nThe defendant was called as a witness, and his account of what happened in the room prior to the shooting was not substantially in conflict with that of the deceased\u2019s sister. He stated that they were in the front of the apartment; that the deceased came into the room, when the defendant said to her, u What did you do with your rings,\u201d to which the deceased replied, \u201c I have got them; \u201d and the defendant said, \u201c I thought perhaps you pawned them; \u201d that the defendant then sat down on the lounge near the fire, the deceased standing in front of the door between the front room and the bedroom; that the defendant took a revolver from his pocket to transfer it to the other pocket, and it caught in his suspenders; that as he did that the deceased grabbed the revolver and attempted to make off with it; that the defendant then grabbed the deceased by the right shoulder, taking the revolver from her; that they struggled to the edge of a bed; that the defendant raised the revolver, when it went off; that the deceased\u2019s sister, who was in the kitchen, then ran into the room screaming murder; that the deceased then said, \u201c If you have shot my sister, run,\u201d and the defendant said, \u201c What for ? \u201d to which she replied, \u201c She don\u2019t like you; she will have you locked up; \u201d whereupon the defendant left the house and subsequently went to Hew Jersey, throwing the revolver in the river as he went across the ferry; that about the second of March he returned and saw the deceased at Bellevue Hospital; that from Bellevue Hospital he took the deceased to the place where he lived in Twenty-fourth street, stayed with her there until she died on the twelfth day of March, and then gave himself up to the police; that after the shooting and before her death the defendant and the deceased were married. There was a small amount of insurance on the deceased\u2019s life which the defendant claimed, as her husband. It also appeared that the deceased was first taken to Boosevelt Hospital, where an operation was performed for the gunshot wound, and she was then transferred to Bellevue Hospital; that while there what was called \u201c resolving pneumonia \u201d developed, which was the cause of her death; that after the death there was an autopsy by the coroner\u2019s physician, who found a bullet wound over the left hip bone, the bullet was broken in two fragments lying at the level of the fifth lumbar spine; that he found a large fecal abscess containing intestinal contents; that this abscess had burrowed down to the brim of the pelvis,, and had caused a clot of blood to form in a large vein which was carried by the blood from the pelvis and the leg to the heart, lodged in the arteries supplying a portion of the right lung, and caused an infection of the lung which finally broke down and became gangrenous and caused the death of the deceased. Thus, the pistol wound caused the abscess, and from that followed the gangrene of the lung which caused death.\nI think there is no serious question but that there was presented by this evidence a question for the jury. The case was submitted to the jury by a charge which seems to have protected all the rights of the defendant, and to which the defendant made no objection and took no exception. The defendant insists that error was committed by the court receiving in rebuttal the evidence of two police officers as to declarations made by the deceased to them after the shooting. The circumstances under which this testimony was -received were as follows: On the part of the defendant testimony of statements made by the deceased were introduced to the effect that the deceased and the defendant were fooling with the revolver and in some manner the revolver went off; that at first she did not know she was shot and thought her sister was shot; that she had told a lie about the defendant; that her sister had told her to make these statements ; that just before she died she sent for her husband to tell him that she was sorry for what she had said, and that the shooting was an accident. In rebuttal the People called two police officers who saw the defendant at the hospital. One of them testified that the deceased said to him that \u201c he (defendant) asked me for these rings and these clothes that he always asked me for every time we had a fight. I told him, now Tom, you get away from here; I don\u2019t want nothing to do with you at all. * * * My sister was out in the other room and she says: \u2018 You children stop your fooling in there.\u2019 Tom says, \u2018 I am not fooling; \u2019 she says at the same time he pulled the revolver out of his pocket and pointed it at me and said e take that; \u2019 \u201d that he then ran away. The defendant moved that this testimony be stricken out and that the jury be instructed to disregard it on the ground that it was incompetent and irrelevant, to which the court said: \u201c Strike out all except, \u2018 He took the pistol from his pocket and said, take that,\u2019 \u201d Another police officer was also allowed to testify that the deceased said to him, \u201c He demanded rings and clothes from her, and when she refused to give them, he put his hand in his pocket, pulled the revolver and fired and said, \u2018 Take that.\u2019 \u201d The defendant move to strike out this testimony, and the court struck it all out except as to the shooting, taking the revolver from his pocket, saying, \u201c Take that,\u201d and to this the defendant excepted. On the following morning the court made this statement : \u201c Yesterday I permitted the police officers to testify to certain statements made to them by the deceased immediately after the shooting, because it seemed fair. Strike out all the testimony of the two police officers as to the statements made to them by the deceased and I instruct you, gentlemen, to pay no attention to those statements.\u201d\n. Counsel for the defendant then said: \u201c In that view I shall ask your Honor to strike out all the testimony of Officer Biggart as to his having had any conversation with the deceased.\u201d To that the court said: \u201c The fact that he had a conversation, of course, would not prejudice the defendant,\u201d to which counsel for the defendant said: \u201c The fact that she gave him that picture.\u201d Whereupon the district attorney said: \u201c I consent that she said, \u2018 It was a picture of the defendant \u2019 be stricken out, but not the fact that it was a picture.\u201d Ho further statement was then made by the defendant, and no further requests to the court in regard to this testimony.\nThe defendant insists that it was error to receive this evidence, the testimony not being sufficient to justify its reception as an ante-mortem deposition of the deceased. The district attorney claims that this testimony was competent in rebuttal to meet the evidence offered by the defendant of the ante-mortem statements of the deceased that the shooting was an accident, and Carver v. United States, (164 U. S. 694) is relied on. In that case it was held that it was error to refuse to allow the defendant to prove declarations of the decedent tending to contradict declarations admitted on behalf of the People whether the contradictory statements were admissible as dying declarations or not. In this case the declarations made to the police officers, which were admitted, were made some time before those introduced by the defendant, when it appears from the testimony that the deceased did not then expect to die. There is no doubt but that declarations made about the same time which were inconsistent with declarations admitted in evidence as dying declarations were admissible, but whether the People could prove declarations by the deceased made immediately after the wound, when there was no expectation of death, to contradict dying declarations made when the deceased had given up hope of recovery, need not be now determined, as we think that if there was any error in admitting these declarations it was cured by the action of the court in striking out the testimony and expressly directing the jury to disregard it and subsequently submitting the case to the jury without reference to this testimony. The defendant excepted to the admission of the testimony and after its admission moved to strike it out. The court granted that motion. Ho further request was made in relation to this evidence by the defendant, and it seems to have been disregarded in the subsequent conduct of the trial. Under those circumstances I do not think the defendant can complain of the admission of the evidence.\nWe think, therefore, that the question as to the admissibility of this evidence is not presented and that the defendant was not prejudiced by the ruling of the court, to which exceptions were taken.\nThere are other exceptions to rulings on questions of evidence, but we do not think any of them well taken or that they require discussion. A' careful examination of the whole record has convinced us that the defendant had a fair trial and that the verdict of the jury is in accordance with the evidence.\nThe judgment appealed from must be affirmed.\nO\u2019Brien, P. J., McLaughlin, Clarke and Houghton, JJ., concurred.\nJudgment affirmed. Order filed.",
